If July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes in higher than expected and interest rates start to come down, Wagner argues that the Magnificent Seven will ""continue to be that funding mechanism, much like what we saw in the middle of July."" ""You saw that capital flow from the Magnificent Seven to some of the smaller-cap cohorts to more of the real estate investment trust areas, the utilities, and even some of the more consumer cyclical and the consumer discretionary area,"" he says. Wagner notes that the flow of capital will remain with the Magnificent Seven because ""there's so much resiliency, there's so much pricing in elasticity that a lot of those companies have."" While the safe move 10 years ago was to invest in staples like utilities, Wagner believes it is now in AI tech names: ""The amount of profit margin and operating leverage that a lot of these Magnificent Seven companies have, that's where the flow of capital is going to go if investors are looking for safety. And so if you think that there's going to be volatility in the market, not just here in the near term, but over say the next three to four months, I'd be putting my capital in the Mag Seven.""

As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

Built like humans and fueled by artificial intelligence, the machines are learning to tackle complicated tasks at a rapid rate. The advancement of generative AI is supercharging how quickly humanoids can learn, backed by vast amounts of data and high-powered chips. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has doubled down on its future, building out an ecosystem that enables robotics makers to customize their products. The Isaac robotics platform, which includes generative AI foundation models and tools, allow developers to simulate real- world movements in the digital world, while Nvidia’s Thor system-on-a-chip (SOC) provides the computing power needed to drive the transformation. Already, Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and others are incorporating humanoids in their work spaces. At a recent shareholder meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the machines had the potential to propel the EV maker into a $25 trillion market cap company. Tesla is looking to capture the market by integrating its Optimus humanoid into factory floors. Musk has said two robots have already been deployed at the company’s Fremont, California factory and predicted “a few thousand” Optimus robots to be working by 2025. But the company faces plenty of competition. Austin-based Apptronik has already signed partnerships with logistics firm GXO and Mercedes-Benz to deploy its humanoids to their floors, while Amazon has begun using Agility’s Digit robot in its test facility. Watch to see what’s NEXT in humanoid robots. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are reversing some of the gains made in Thursday's trading session as volatility rocks the market. Edward Jones senior investment strategist Mona Mahajan explains, ""Markets have certainly calmed much more meaningfully over the last couple of days than we saw Monday and Tuesday of this week even... We've seen this week alone the jobless claim figures that came in below expectations provided a little comfort to the market that is really looking for direction on a couple of things. One, is the US labor market headed towards some sort of meaningful collapse or downside, and two, is the broader economy headed towards a downturn as well? And I think for us, both of the answers to both of those questions are no."" The tech sector has been particularly rocked by market volatility this week, yet Goldman Sachs Asset Management fundamental equity managing director Luke Barrs still sees opportunity. ""Selectively, there's great opportunity across the broad market, but specifically in tech as well. There are some transformational themes that are coming through that are driving earnings,"" he explains. He adds, ""When we come to technology, what is very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture, but also the fact that people want to see... evidence that that gen AI trade is actually driving positive outcomes."" A global market sell-off occurred on Monday after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates, which unwinded the yen carry trade (JPY=X). TD Securities global head of FX and EM strategy Mark McCormick believes that the carry trade unwind isn't over, explaining, ""The structural nature of the carry trade is that for pretty much around the last decade, Japanese investors have put their money, mostly pension funds, which accounts for about 80% of GDP in other markets. So the assets that they're tracking in other markets are actually a big form of the carry trade."" Some retail investors used the market sell-off as a buying opportunity. IG Group North America CEO JJ Kinahan notes, ""Every crisis... we've had over the last five years, where retail traders tend to start are two technology names, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT)."" He adds that ""Apple and Microsoft are going to be names that retail trades significantly anyways, but made up a larger percentage of trading on Monday and Tuesday, for sure, as people were looking for places to go buy.""

""But clearly as the focus changes on onto the monetization of AI, from here on you don't want to pay very high multiples and you want to see actually the monetization showing up in earnings. And clearly this is a secular trend...""

Wall Street was rocked on Monday as US equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) were in a free fall, finding some relief and eventually staging a bounce back on Tuesday. Part of those declines is due in part to issues with the Bank of Japan raising its interest rates. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is also bouncing back after a large drop in value, currently sitting above $50,000. Yahoo Finance Reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the top takeaways for the trading day on Tuesday, August 6. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst Jackson Ader joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into the tech sector, how its performing, and what investors need to know. In terms of a chief concern this earnings season for Big Tech CapEx spending, Ader relates back to Microsoft (MSFT) and its recent earnings: ""What Microsoft said was, hey, we're actually a little bit more flexible than maybe you realize only half of our CapEx really goes into those fixed long term, 15, 20 year assets. And the other half is kits and GPUs. Maybe they're going to be GPUs, maybe they're going to be CPUs, maybe they're going to be in-house chips, but the focus on flexibility in artificial intelligence, I think is going to be a really good one, and key for the industry..."" The S&P 500 recovered some of its sell-off losses, closing Tuesday's session 1.03% higher. While the widespread selling activity erased a sizable chunk of the Magnificent Seven's market cap, is this pattern of peak-to-trough declines really unprecedented for the index? Julie Hyman breaks down Goldman Sachs charts illustrating the S&P 500's history of sell-offs and ability to bounce back from similar pullbacks. Oil markets (CL=F, BZ=F) are experiencing a rebound along the broader market and as tensions rise in the Middle East. Sankey Research president and lead analyst Paul Sankey explains, ""This latest issue that we're facing between Israel and Iran is not in itself even a new twist to the plot. And in that regard, if you think back to, say, 2019, when Iranian proxies attacked Saudi Arabia and knocked out 7 million barrels a day of capacity, or when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, I'm sad to say that the current environment is not very scary for oil supply interruptions. I will say that the markets are quite scary. So the financial markets are really driving oil right now."" Lastly, a slew of companies released their latest quarterly reports after the market close.

In terms of a chief concern this earnings season for tech, capex spending, Ader relates back to Microsoft (MSFT) and its recent earnings: ""What Microsoft said was, 'hey, we're actually a little bit more flexible than maybe you realize.

The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are slipping as recession fears trigger a widespread sell-off among investors. However, Fort Washington Investment Advisors co-chief investment officer Chris Shipley believes the current downturn shouldn't cause investor panic. He notes the market had ""a certain vulnerability"" due to expectations of economic growth and lower inflation. Yet, there turned out to be ""a little more economic weakness than the market was banking on,"" indicating the economy is entering ""a more substantial slowdown."" He views the current situation as an ideal buying opportunity, pointing to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which hasn't seen low share prices since March or April, noting: ""When stocks are on sale, it's time to start taking a look."" Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry argues that the market has been ""a little bit overdue for a pullback like this."" Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities. Some investors are concerned about the pullback's effects on their long-term retirement investments. Vanguard senior wealth advisor Cassandra Rupp, CFP, says, ""We can only control what we can control,"" and breaks down some of the biggest mistakes when managing 401(k) plans: ""Everyone's time horizon can be different. I mean, if we're speaking to some of this reporting in 401(k)'s for retirement savings, depends on what stage of your career you're at. We're seeing an increase in participant deferral rates above 4% now. So we're seeing more and more individuals start to automatically save out of their paychecks into these types of plans."" Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Kerry Hannon adds that if you're investing in a retirement account, you will experience periods where you're buying high and periods where you're buying low. In the end, it'll most likely even out. In response to recent signs of economic weakness, Wall Street is convinced the Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting. However, with investors believing the Fed may be delayed in rate reductions, speculation is growing about a potential cut even sooner. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jennifer Schonberger breaks down the details, discussing how the Fed can implement rate cuts outside of their scheduled meetings and historical trends that prompted emergency rate cuts.

Ansari recommends Microsoft (MSFT) as a top stock to buy. He points out that the company's current valuation is down, presenting an opportunity for investors. Additionally, he believes the rotation away from tech stocks is overhyped, stating ""we're in the early innings of the AI revolution"" and suggesting that capital expenditure shouldn't deter investors. Lastly, Ansari emphasizes that Microsoft stands to benefit from its AI investments in the long run. Microsoft reported a second quarter earnings beat this past Tuesday. On the other hand, Ansari advises avoiding Groupon (GRPN) stock. He notes that the ""entire company has shrunk,"" resulting in declining revenue. Furthermore, their second quarter earnings reported a net loss, which he believes will be ""reflected in the stock price."" Ansari also points out that Groupon is no longer a top consumer brand, further diminishing its appeal as an investment.

Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking For A Trade to give insight into the tech sector, the AI trade, and what it means for Big Tech moving forward into the earnings season. Moorhead reiterates his thought from a previous interview: ""I really laid out a thesis that says the infrastructure build-out is going to continue for at least another year and maybe 18 months, and that's driven primarily by the downstream FOMO, or the fear of missing out, from those enterprise SaaS providers. Meta, who clearly showed that they're investing hardcore because they have to. If you are not investing in your competitors, you could be set back potentially a decade here. Moorhead is also looking at the long-term valuations of AI-adjacent software companies and chip designers like ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARM) He ends with his thoughts that Nvidia (NVDA) has ""at least another 12 months to run. We saw TSMC (TSM), where Nvidia does all of their manufacturing, they're basically sold out through 2025 and into 2026. We just heard from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta that that they're putting the pedal to the metal on this. And all of this is goodness for Nvidia.""

Winthrop Capital Management portfolio manager Luke Stone joins Catalysts to discuss these market dynamics. Stone observes a ""rotation narrative"" in the markets, where the Magnificent Seven stocks' valuations are considered too lofty, making it ""very hard to hit"" expectations. As this trend continues, he suggests investors may reduce their positions in these stocks and look elsewhere in the broader market for attractive opportunities. ""Investors are growing a little bit impatient that we're kicking the can down the road,"" Stone notes, referring to Big Tech names as investors wait for AI investments to yield returns. He cautions, ""all of this CapEx [capital expenditures] is great today, but if you don't have a customer base to execute on in a year from now, or if that customer base declines from worsening economic scenarios, you're going to run into issues down the road.""

Despite beating estimates on both revenue and earnings, the tech giant fell short on Intelligent Cloud revenue expectations. Piper Sandler equity research analyst for cloud software and analytics Brent Bracelin joins Market Domination to discuss whether AI expectations for tech companies are too lofty. Bracelin identifies the Azure business as ""the primary growth engine"" for Microsoft. While the company increased spending on AI and cloud infrastructure during the quarter, the report showed slowing growth in the Azure business, which Bracelin notes is ""a little bit of a confusing thing for investors"". However, he suggests that reacceleration in this segment could occur as early as next year, saying there were some macro headwinds for the business in the quarter. ""I think it's important to take a step back, look at the bigger picture here,"" Bracelin told Yahoo Finance. He points out that it took Microsoft 13 years to build the Azure business to its current state, investing nearly $179 billion. ""We're talking now adding the next $100 billion in three years, so you're gonna compress 13 years of capex spend in three years to add the next $100 billion.""

It's widely expected the Fed will leave rates unchanged, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments at the news conference will be put under a microscope as investors look for hints that a rate cut could be coming in September. It's a tale of two Big Tech stocks. Microsoft's (MSFT) fiscal fourth quarter results topped Street estimates, but revenue from its Intelligent Cloud unit disappointed. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported better-than-expected second quarter results and issued upbeat Q3 guidance thanks to demand for its AI chips. Boeing (BA) is also in focus.

Ortberg, who was formerly CEO of Rockwell Collins, will replace CEO David Calhoun, who announced his intention to step down by the end of the year.

RBC Capital Markets Software equity analyst Rishi Jaluria joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into Microsoft's results. Jaluria says his biggest takeaway from the report was that there has been ""a little bit of a reversal of the trends that we saw last quarter."" He says the issue is that Azure ""ex-AI"" decelerated in this quarter whereas it had accelerated the prior quarter. He says he will be looking for more information about the company's capital expenditures outlook on the call. In terms of what to expect with the AI sector Jaluria states: ""I think what we're learning is it's very early in AI. Capex is going to be through the roof because this AI is really capital intensive. It's totally resource intensive. And there is a little bit of an air pocket behind enterprises having discussions in AI and actually using AI widely within the organization. And at the same time, I do think we are seeing some competitive dynamics where Azure may be potentially gaining share versus the other hyperscale cloud providers.""

Investors are keenly watching to see how AI spending will impact company revenues. Neuberger Berman senior research Analyst Daniel Flax joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook. Flax believes that upcoming tech earnings will highlight ""the buildout of the cloud infrastructure"" and AI. With Amazon and Microsoft earnings on the horizon, he notes, ""I expect they'll see strong growth"" within Azure and Amazon Web Services. He points out that the cloud businesses among tech giants are generating substantial revenues, arguing that ""this need to invest, I think, is the right strategy,"" despite acknowledging that revenue generation from AI specifically will take time. ""I do think the investments or the capital expenditures are a necessary part of it. I expect you'll see incremental revenues from these newer areas over the next 12-24 months.

Liz Young Thomas SoFi head of investment strategy joins Market Domination to give insight into Big Tech earnings and what investors need to know during this current economic cycle. In terms of how investors are moving during this notion of a rotation, Young Thomas states: ""I think what's going on actually right now with the rotation is that some of those big cap tech names have given some back, because when people look at their portfolios, that is the easiest stuff to sell. You've got a big gain in it. It's a very liquid name, professional investors see those as easy to sell as well. So it's an easy place to take some profits and rotate.

McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 — commonly referred to as the 493 — being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

San Jose State Professor Ahmed Banafa explains that the outage affected many more people than a typical IT failure impacting just one company. He notes that the reason it's taking so long to fix the issue is because it requires manually deleting the file that created the chaos from thousands of computers, a process that could take weeks. With systems compromised, hackers can take advantage of this situation by creating phishing emails along with fake research and websites to gain access to affected parties. When asked how individuals could keep their computers safe, Banafa emphasized thinking before clicking and only using help directly from Microsoft and CrowdStrike. In addition, Banafa notes that no one questions a software update, and as a result, 8.5 million devices suffered this outage. He thinks that the incident may prompt Microsoft to reconsider its relationship with CrowdStrike due to the negative publicity.

The outage occurred when CrowdStrike sent out an update for its software that impacted Microsoft (MSFT) systems that are used by everything from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies.  Howley explains, ""When an update goes out, it points to different flaws in systems that attackers also learn about. An update goes out, the information is published about it. Attackers aren't dumb, and so they know what the update's fixing. If companies don't apply those updates and fix those flaws, then attackers can go after them. So, the updates were applied across the board to CrowdStrike customers and that's why we saw this huge cascade of failures."" He adds that CrowdStrike is working on deploying a patch, but it may take longer for companies to get the fixes. In the meantime, some companies are manually fixing issues where they can in order to get operations back on track. However, Howley notes, ""It's not something that they can just automate. And so it's not something that's just going to go away at the drop of a hat. This is something that's going to take a while to truly remediate.""

A recent CrowdStrike update caused a global outage that impacted Microsoft Windows (MSFT) systems across multiple industries. The incident has affected or even halted operations in banking, airline operators, and even emergency services around the world. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley provides a detailed analysis of the incident, shedding light on the concerns surrounding the small group of companies that are responsible for operating internet systems globally. Netflix (NFLX) reported its second-quarter earnings results and announced plans to discontinue its cheapest ad-free plan in the US and France. Citi managing director Jason Bazinet notes that Netflix's restructuring efforts are ""complicated"" as the company strives for profitability. However, he highlights that the ad-tier business has been ""consistent with our expectations,"" with growth in sales, although it has been under-monetized. Meanwhile, the tech sector (XLK) is continuing to see a downturn as some investors on Wall Street are rotating out into other sectors and small-cap stocks (^RUT). EquitySet CEO Tony Zipparro comments on which areas of the market will be most sensitive to rate cuts: ""That's capital-intensive industries, right? Where you've got not the greatest— where they're trying to get the profitability, right? You've got a lot of debt on the books. You really have to be cautious."" Many would-be homebuyers are choosing to sit on the sidelines and instead rent for longer as housing costs remain elevated. Yahoo Finance contributor Ross Mac joins Wealth! to break down some scenarios where either buying or renting could make the most sense for you. Chase Home Lending Head of Consumer Originations Sean Grzebin believes the housing market is getting some relief, explaining, ""Now that rates have been high for some period of time, we're starting to see a little easing. I think customers are becoming more comfortable listing, and we're actually seeing inventories grow for the first time in several years."" 70% of employees are bracing for potential layoffs, whether by saving money or applying to new jobs, according to a survey from MarketWatch Guides. MarketWatch Guides data journalist Matt Brannon lays out one of the biggest finds in the study: ""One of the big ones is that age gap. So we found that Baby Boomers feel more secure in their jobs. It makes sense. They've worked for decades building up their seniority. Whereas Gen Z workers, 88% are taking steps to prevent, a job loss trying to preempt it in some sort of way, layoff anxiety is a term that we asked about to find out just how concerned people are and a majority of Gen Z workers and nearly half of Millennials are anxious about being laid off.

One issue is a CrowdStrike (CRWD) update to some Windows devices that impacted operations across companies worldwide. Defused Cyber Deception Researcher and Founder Simo Kohonen joins to discuss the implications for CrowdStrike and the broader cybersecurity landscape. Kohonen explains that CrowdStrike ""pushed out a faulty update"" that, when installed, ""broke everything,"" affecting industries globally. He emphasizes CrowdStrike's reputation as the ""top number one cybersecurity company in the world"" and notes that their extensive customer base amplifies the scale of this issue. While the issue is fixable, he cautions that the timeline for resolving this problem may vary. ""From a very technical perspective, if you want to run this type of software which has a lot of capabilities, with great power comes great responsibility,"" Kohonen told Yahoo Finance. He adds, ""I think CrowdStrike will have a lot of conversations with their current customers and their future customers about what they're doing differently. They might take a short-term hit from it, but they're still an extremely reputable vendor.""

Nintendo exec talks game industry 'poised for an upswing',"The video game industry is reaching outside of its comfort zone as audiences are seeing exposure to more video game adaptations, TV series, M&A activity between studios, and even partnerships with popular streaming services. ""The overall entertainment industry is large, it's a significant part of the global economy. And gaming is the biggest part of that — it's a $200 billion business today. It's bigger than streaming, bigger than the movie box office. Across the globe, 3 billion people play video games,"" former Nintendo (NTDOY) of America President and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé explains to Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend. An industry veteran, Fils-Aimé held the positions of Nintendo of America president and COO from 2006 to 2019. He believes the gaming industry is ""poised for an upswing"" following post-pandemic contractions from game studios and consumers. Fils-Aimé weighs in on rising trends in gaming, including VR and AR headsets (virtual reality and augmented reality) — namely Apple's (AAPL) costly Vision Pro — and cloud gaming technology. Cloud gaming is ""just going to be another way that consumers can get access to games in the end, this is an industry that is driven by content,"" Fils-Aimé says, underlining the fact that it will ""always come down to the games"" no matter the platform or hardware behind it.

Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss some of the biggest trends dominating the tech sector as second quarter earnings season kicks off. Luria points to Microsoft's (MSFT) AI efforts driving a PC upgrade cycle. He explains, ""the impact is so broad right now in the implementation of more AI and generative AI, including in the PC category... AI PCs have been for sale. They'll probably be part of a cycle as well. It may not be as pronounced as the iPhone cycle, but considering PC sales have been in a hangover the last couple of years, they've started showing signs of growth."" He believes that the outperformance of tech stocks boils down to the fact that tech companies have ""grown earnings when others have not."" He also attributes the growth to diversification, explaining, ""they present less risk because their businesses are so entrenched and diversified."" He highlights Amazon (AMZN) as an example, and expects it to be well-positioned ahead of its earnings. He argues, ""AWS is the biggest hyperscaler, and it's done a lot to catch up to Azure in terms of AI capabilities. And yet Amazon is getting very little credit in terms of multiple. It's trading at at average multiple compared to its historical rates. And so we think that's where when they get more credit that stock will outperform.""

As AI competition from Big Tech names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) heat up, can Musk's new company keep up or will it eclipse them entirely? Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton joins Asking for a Trend to discuss why he is invested in xAI and believes Musk has an interesting point of view when it comes to advocating for new tech ideas, like artificial intelligence. ""I think you have to really have a deep respect for figuring out... the sciences, figuring out physics. And if you think about who in the world has done the most to figure out things, physical problems like we just talked about, it's Tesla, it's SpaceX, and it's Elon. And so I think he's probably in a different and more unique position than some of these other companies, like a Google, like an OpenAI, who are great in the digital space, but they're sort of amateurs in the physical space.

Now Amazon (AMZN) wants to own the chips that power its cloud and boost profits by gaining share in the chips market, currently led by Nvidia (NVDA). Yahoo Finance got an exclusive first look at AWS’s latest chip, called the Graviton4. What makes this latest chip special? It’s the most powerful and efficient AWS chip to date. It’s 35% faster than the prior generation and has 75% more memory bandwidth. It’s the latest example of the research and development tech firms are willing to pour into chip development. AI is fueling demand for semiconductors - the guts that power the AI boom - meaning companies have to build those guts at a record-breaking pace. Whoever does it the fastest stands to grab up chip juggernaut Nvidia's market share - currently 80% of the GPU chips market. That’s fueling a race between tech and chips companies, not only fueled by competition but also propelled by government incentives designed to fight back against China and have the United States retake the lead as the world’s dominant global chip manufacturer. Can AWS get a larger slice of the chips market pie? Here’s what’s next in the chips race. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT in the business of neurotechnology.

As Nvidia continues on its downward trajectory after leading the S&P 500's (^GSPC) growth, B. Riley Wealth Chief Market Strategist Art Hogan believes the market can keep up its momentum without the chip giant: ""I think it's a perfect example of a lot of folks being concerned that Nvidia and arguably Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) were such a big part of the 15% that the S&P 500 is higher this year on a year to date basis... But you're seeing basically three or four days where Nvidia has not been leading the charge, and the market's done very well. I think that continues throughout the second half of this year."" The European Union has charged Apple under its Digital Markets Act, alleging that the tech giant's App Store practices prevent app developers from directing consumers to cheaper services. TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell believes the investigation is unlikely to conclude anytime soon, and that Apple will have to make some changes: ""I do think Apple is going to have to make some tweaks, some things that they don't necessarily want to do, but at the end of the day, again, it's an important enough market that they're going to have to follow some of these requirements that the EU is putting into place. And therefore, long term, I don't think the impact is that big of a deal as far as the value of the company and the way people view the stock."" Cryptocurrencies are also under pressure, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) having its worst trading day since March. Meanwhile, the health industry is making major moves, as Altimmune (ALT) reported positive results in Phase 2 trials for its weight-loss drug, a Teladoc Health (TDOC) study showed its AI models contributed to positive growth in diabetes management, and Novo Nordisk revealed plans to invest $4.1 billion in building out a manufacturing facility in Clayton, North Carolina for its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

Some on Wall Street have begun to question whether the stock can continue its historic rally. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) has reclaimed its title as the most valuable US company in market capitalization. Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into the performance of the Big Tech stocks and explain what investors should consider for their portfolios. ""We think that mega-caps drove the first leg of this upturn this year. And as we get into the second half, we think the upturn will broaden to mid-cap stocks. So that's where we are really looking most for opportunities. We still like Nvidia. We still see a lot of upside, but we don't think it's going to be as outsized of a performer compared to the rest of our portfolio,"" Delevska explains. She adds that cybersecurity is a ""particularly exciting"" sector because the fundamentals are improving ""by the day.""

The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened mixed in Friday's session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading gains early in the trading day. Nvidia's (NVDA) reign as the US's most valuable publicly traded company was brief. The semiconductor giant shed $118 billion in market capitalization, allowing Microsoft (MSFT) to reclaim the top spot. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead emphasizes that Nvidia's continued dominance hinges on sustained enterprise demand for its offerings. If customers stop buying Nvidia's offerings, he warns, ""then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt."" Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global market strategist Scott Wren notes that while the computer services and technology sectors are currently ""very highly valued, very momentum driven,"" investors should consider trimming some of their gains in these areas and reallocating into sectors like industrials, energy, and healthcare. The pharmaceutical and biotech sectors are making major moves as Sarepta (SRPT) received expanded approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its muscular dystrophy drug, and Gilead (GILD) saw encouraging results from its twice-yearly shot to prevent HIV. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer has upgraded Nike (NKE) from Perform to Outperform and raised its price target from $110 to $120. Meta (META) also received a bullish call, as KeyBanc raised its price target from $475 to $540, citing sustained advertising momentum. Keybanc Managing Director Justin Patterson explains that Meta's ad revenue is ""accelerating sequentially"" despite intensifying competition, indicating that ""demand for Meta's advertisements remains very high.""

128179309,2024-06-10,14:12:31,2024-06-10 14:12:31,"YF Reports: AI Chip Wars: Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, & AMD","All this week, business leaders in the chip industry gathered at the COMPUTEX Conference in Tapei, Taiwan; all with the stated purpose of showing off their companies latest products and developments. Current industry front runner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled its most impressive next-generation AI chip, nicknamed Rubin. Meanwhile AMD (AMD) announced their AMD Instict MI325X accelerator, showing how the company plans on leading the AI space in performance and memory. Intel (INTC) plans on finding their own niche in the heavily sought after market, announcing their new Gaudi 3 AI Chips; a more affordable option for cost-conscious customers. As the AI revolution heats up, who will come out on top of the AI Chip Wars. Here is what you need to know: Nvidia is the undisputed heavy-weight in the AI space. Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita explains: ""Tough to argue with anybody being the big winner except Nvidia so far when you consider the sheer scale of they've been able to accomplish. When you talk about data center revenue alone, the category that has seen the biggest bump from the AI boom, rose 427% from a year ago in it's most recent quarter."" Nvidia may have won the battle, but they have not yet won the war. Competitors like AMD & Intel are making aggressive inroads. I/O Fund Lead Analyst Beth Kindig breaks it down: ""In this AI battle, this AI competition between AMD and Nvidia, I estimate that AMD is capable of taking somewhere between 10% to maximum 20% of the market. This is based on the gaming competition these two companies have had for some time. Intel, they are moving well past 20%. Intel is an easier competitor than Nvidia. I think Nvidia is going to be a tougher competitor for AMD.""  Even though Nvidia dominates the AI space, no market wants to rely on only one company. KeyBlanc Capital Markets Analyst John Vinh discusses why Nvidia's monopoly in the microchip industry is a cause for concern, and a clear sign of opportunity for other companies to wrestle back some of the lion share from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. ""The market is really badly looking for a credible second source to Nvidia. Nvidia is making 90% gross margins on its AI chips and the industry badly, badly wants are credible second source on the emergence side."" One company that is setting their target on the emergence side is Intel. At COMPUTEX they unveiled the new Gaudi 3 AI Chip, a more affordable option for companies who want to dip their toes in the emerging generative-AI market, but who may be scared off by the high price point of Nvida or AMD. Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley discusses: ""Now Intel, they announced their Gaudi Chip pricing, which they say is going to come in less than what you would see from Nvidia. The hyperscalers: the Microsoft's the Google's, they're all in on Nvidia at this point. This will allow for other companies outside of hyperscalers to get into generative-AI at a potentially lower price. It's healthcare, it's individual research institutes, it's automotive industries. That is where Intel could really shine."" Another dark horse in these AI Chip wars is Qualcomm (QCOM). They have set their sights on making powerful computer processors able to handle artificial intelligence features. Microsoft took notice, partnering with the San Diego based company on the release of their new Surface Laptops and Surface Pro Tablets. Dan Howley continues: ""If you look at what Microsoft did, they used Qualcomm chips to launch this new category of computers, and that's a big deal. That means they have full faith in what Qualcomm can do.""  This post was written by Noah Chadwick",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=583b8ea9d3375595b346b52a3ae79c09b3728e8e70652f0ad2570e3bbffe6a49

Rocks,"As the world’s largest companies scramble to tackle the impacts of climate change, Big Tech is betting on a surprisingly low-tech solution to reach their net-zero goal. Enhanced rock weathering already happens naturally over thousands of years, but startup Lithos Carbon is accelerating the process, spreading leftover rock dust across farm fields. The company is scaling its operation with financial backing from Frontier, a consortium of investors that include Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and JPMorgan (JPM). The climate fund, led by payments processing company Stripe, committed $57.1 million to Lithos Carbon last year to remove over 154,000 tons of carbon. Lithos Carbon is one of hundreds of startups globally that are competing in a carbon removal industry expected to reach $135 billion by 2040, according to consulting firm BCG. Once considered a workaround for critical emission-cutting work, carbon removal technologies, which extract and sequester carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, are increasingly seen as a necessary step to capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, as laid out in the Paris Agreement. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the world needs to remove up to 10 billion tons of carbon per year by the middle of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Roughly 2,400 companies have disclosed having net-zero targets in place, according to nonprofit group CDP. Many of those firms are turning to carbon removal technologies to offset emissions, as they realize that emissions reductions alone won’t get them within their net-zero goals. Demand for carbon credits is projected to quadruple from 2030 to 2040, according to BCG. Big Tech firms are among the biggest buyers of carbon removal credits. Microsoft (MSFT), the leading buyer globally, has purchased more than 7.6 million carbon credits, since 2020 according to online tracker CDR.fyi.

SOCi CEO Afif Khoury joins Asking For a Trend to discusses the study's methodology and findings. Khoury elaborates on the findings: ""The spin on it may currently not be in favor of GPT in the sense that, generative AI tools, they have access to the internet. So GPT has access to this local data as much as Bing or Google do because it's public, publicly found information, but it does come down to how they write their algorithms and what they prioritize and Google has been in the local game for a long time and heavily prioritizes that data. So I wouldn't say it's unfair in that different companies have access to different information, but if when you pick a certain topic, some may be better than others for that topic, depending on what they prioritize.""

Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Asking for a Trend to break down the earnings and analyze how long the company can keep up the momentum. Despite beating Wall Street's expectations, Basenese highlights that the magnitude of Nvidia's beat is the smallest it has ever been, at about 8%. He warns, ""Expectations at some point are going to get too far ahead of what Nvidia can deliver, but it's not yet."" ""I think it's the leading candidate to be the next $3 trillion market cap company, but if I had a dollar to put to work today and I want to 10x it, it's not Nvidia. It's probably in the smaller cap side of the market,"" he adds, saying that of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is the most ""reasonably valued."" Basenese calls Nvidia's stock split a ""brilliant move psychologically,"" as buying a stock at a lower price is more enticing. He adds that it does not change any of Nvidia's fundamental metrics or value calculations. For investors looking to get in on the AI sector, Basenese highlights Microsoft's (MSFT) ability to push AI products onto the market to create demand. He also points to Apple (AAPL) as ""the sleeper AI play.""  ""Apple is kind of perceived as they missed the boat ... they're never first or second to market. They come in later, but then they go. They come in late, but they end up being the leader."" He adds, ""They have two billion active devices in use. If they just iterate and add a little AI somewhere, it has a magnified impact.""

RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst Rishi Jaluria and Macquarie Head of US AI & Software Research Frederick Havemeyer join Market Domination to discuss the company's latest AI play. ""I think the introduction of these AI PCs is actually going to be a really big game changer to getting generative AI in the hands of every knowledge worker out there,"" Jaluria explains. He adds that users will be able to use these small and medium language models locally, generating more AI use for general purposes. When it comes to large language models, Havemeyer says, ""It's very clear to us that the technology of a generative AI model of large language models is something that will find fit with consumers over time. ChatGPT did, and I think that with the right interface and the right platform, we'll find it over time."" AI is seeping into all sectors as companies seek to innovate and find efficiencies. ""80% of CIOs are telling us that they are either currently in production or expect to be in production with AI over the next 12 months, so the appetite is real, the use cases are real,"" Jaluria explains, adding that there is still a lot of room for the technology to grow.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said he favors holding higher interest rates for longer, needing several months of favorable inflation data before pursuing rate cuts. Hennion & Walsh chief investment officer Kevin Mahn warns that this could be a slippery slope: ""I think the Fed needs to be careful because if they keep rates too high for too long, they risk their own forecasted economic slowdown moving into a recessionary period."" Microsoft's (MSFT) Build event kicked off with a series of announcements, like new plans to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o into its Azure AI Studio offering. This is the tech giant's latest artificial intelligence push to make it a key competitor as the AI race heats up. Ethereum (ETH-USD) prices are surging amid renewed optimism of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving an ether ETF. Similar action in the crypto market was also seen in the lead-up to the SEC's decision on spot bitcoin ETFs at the start of 2024. Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan expresses confidence, stating that the odds for a spot ether ETF approval are ""up above 80% before the end of the year."" On the retail front, Lowe's (LOW) and Macy's (M) both topped earnings expectations. However, shares of Lowe's are falling after the home improvement retailer saw a pullback among consumers in the do-it-yourself (DIY) segment, with sales in that category declining. Meanwhile, shares of Macy's are climbing after the company raised its full-year guidance amid weak consumer spending.

Ives states that Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference will be paramount for Apple: ""I think it's probably the most important event for Apple that we've seen potentially in a decade because this is going to be [CEO Tim] Cook laying out the AI strategy on the services side for developers, what I believe is really the start of an AI app store in terms of how that's going to morph and then its proprietary AI technology in iPhone 16, which will launch in September.""

She also likes that it has a lot of potential growth from AI.  Otto is less of a fan of Meta. She argues that its higher expense guidance ""suggests that the 'year of efficiency' is potentially over."" So why is Mircosoft's spending on AI good, while Meta's spending is a concern? Otto says there are two reasons: Meta's expenses have ramped up more than expected and that there is a lack of visibility surrounding those expenses.

Big Tech earnings, the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, and the closely watched jobs report are all scheduled to unfold. Wells Fargo Senior Global Market Strategist Scott Wren joins The Morning Brief to provide insights into how these developments might impact markets and the Federal Reserve's rate cut outlook. With the FOMC meeting and decision announcement slated for Wednesday, Wren believes ""we're not going to see any surprises,"" predicting that the higher-for-longer interest rate environment will likely persist. He believes that two rate cuts could materialize in 2024, starting in September. The next most likely scenario is ""fewer cuts, not more,"" Wren says. As the Big Tech earnings season continues to unfold this week, Wren believes the tech and communications services sectors are ""overvalued."" However, he acknowledges that with industry heavyweights like Microsoft (MSFT) driving market rallies post-earnings, ""clearly the market is going to hang on results"" for a few days.

As a result, shares of the tech giant are higher Thursday after the market close. CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss Microsoft's results.

Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan and Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Strategist Ben Bajarin joined Market Domination to discuss the potential impact of artificial intelligence on Big Tech earnings. Bajarin highlights two main concerns: ""Who's getting the most beneficiary lift from AI stocks?"" and ""Do we have outsized expectations of AI growth?"" However, he believes tech earnings will see strong growth due to AI infrastructure investments. Bajarin expresses worry about potential volatility stemming from ""the bubble-ish cycle of AI."" He also notes that costs associated with AI innovation could be a factor affecting earnings. Morgan emphasizes that if investors look beyond the AI hype, Big Tech is ""looking at very strong growth"" across the core business models. While companies like AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) do have substantial profit growth fueled by AI, Morgan notes that for earnings from names like Microsoft and Meta there won't be ""a huge AI effect, in terms of like 30% growth coming from AI, but their core businesses are very strong."" He adds that if the Federal Reserve were to refrain from cutting rates and inflation remains elevated, these tech giants ""are delivering growth regardless of what the Fed is doing.""

Pelosky offers his views on China's tech sector: ""We're more keen on tech outside the United States, and in particular, in China. And so, we have identified what we call a two-tech stack divide between the US and China, where both countries are basically sealing off their tech sectors from each other, and we think that creates a real opportunity within China tech, which has been a huge laggard versus the US. Its e-commerce market is twice the size of the US, growing at 10% per annum, and the stocks, like Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (0700.HK), etc, are trading at a 50 to 60% discount to the United States tech stocks.""

Recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East haven't been the sole detractor from 2024's market momentum. One of the leaders in the S&P is chip-making powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) which is down 15% over the past month. Is the rally for Big Tech players over or just on a pause? F/m Investments President and Chief Investment Officer Alex Morris joins Market Domination to discuss the chip sector and Nvidia's recent dip in share price. Morris weighs in on the current market landscape and how Nvidia has performed recently: ""It's surprising to see it today. There's no great catalyst for it. Nvidia didn't come out and say 'we're out of the game, AI is over.' But we have to remember Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Big Tech names, they're momentum names and momentum names occasionally need to take a breather... The geopolitical events aren't the catalyst but they are a good opportunity for folks to reevaluate where their money is and sometimes you take your profits.""

In 2023 alone, the company generated over $211 billion in revenue, and currently boasts a market cap of more than $3 trillion, making it the wealthiest publicly traded company in the world. What led to that success? Beyond the Ticker takes a closer look at the company's biggest moments. 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975 to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. 1980 Microsoft signed a contract with IBM (IBM) to bundle Microsoft's operating system, an early version of its MS-DOS, with IBM computers. 1985 Microsoft announced the first version of Windows, an operating system composed of a graphical user interface running on top of MS-DOS. 1986 On March 13, 1986, Microsoft kicked off its IPO, raising $61 million at $21 per share. 1995 On August 24, 1995, Microsoft launched Windows 95. The software would go on to be wildly popular among PC consumers and enterprise customers. 2000 Steve Ballmer took the reins at Microsoft, succeeding Bill Gates as the company’s second CEO. 2001 The company jumped headlong into the console gaming wars with the debut of the first Xbox. 2008 Microsoft dove into the cloud computing space with its Azure service. 2014 Ballmer retired as Microsoft CEO, turning over the position to Satya Nadella. 2019 Microsoft’s market cap crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time. 2023 Microsoft kicked off its push into generative AI with a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and the debut of several generative AI products including its revamped Bing search engine and Copilot software. The company is now riding the AI hype train as far as it can, adding generative AI software to everything from Office to Windows and everything in between.

126843670,2024-04-04,17:44:20,2024-04-04 17:44:20,Amazon history: Beyond the Ticker,"From its start as an online bookstore to its rise in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon (AMZN) has become one of the world's most iconic brands. In 2023, the tech juggernaut generated over $575 billion in revenue, boasting more than 200 million Amazon Prime members worldwide. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into some of the company's biggest moments. 1994 Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington. It was originally an online bookstore designed to compete with Barnes & Noble (BNED). 1997 On May 15, 1997, Amazon went public via IPO at $18 per share, giving it a valuation of $300 million. 1998 Amazon began selling CDs, marking the start of its effort to become a shopping Goliath. 2005 The company launched Amazon Prime, a $79 per year membership with free two-day shipping on eligible orders. 2006 Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform would go on to become the top cloud computing platform, ahead of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and one of Amazon’s most successful businesses. 2011 The company rebranded its video service as Amazon Instant Video with access to 5,000 movies and TV shows for Prime members. 2014 Amazon acquired the video game streaming website Twitch for $970 million. 2017 Amazon acquired high-end supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. It has since integrated the two companies, offering discounts to Prime members. 2018 On September 4, 2018, Amazon became just the second US company ever to reach a $1 trillion market cap, after Apple (AAPL) reached it earlier in the year. 2020 Amazon's sales and profits surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, as consumers turned to online shopping. Its total sales increased 38% year-over-year to $386.1 billion, and net income increased 83% to $21.3 billion. 2021 Founder Jeff Bezos announced that he would step down from his role as CEO and be succeeded by AWS CEO Andy Jassy. 2024 Amazon was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing drugstore giant Walgreens (WBA). The company continues to evolve, investing billions in AI startup Anthropic, developing more smart home products, and launching an AI shopping assistant named Rufus. It’s safe to say Amazon is a staple of the digital age.

126774099,2024-04-01,09:55:34,2024-04-01 09:55:34,Exclusive: Fusion reactor promises limitless energy,"Fusion energy has long been hailed as the holy grail because of its potential for limitless amounts of clean energy. But that promise has trailed reality for decades, with billions of dollars in research leading to few breakthroughs. Now there’s optimism that is about to change, partly because of new startups funded by the likes of Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates. Yahoo Finance went inside the country’s largest magnetic fusion facility for an exclusive look, to explore the challenges of bringing this technology to commercial use for the latest episode of NEXT. “The race is on to actually see who can develop this and who can get it to the masses the fastest,” said David Callaway, former editor-in-chief of USA Today and founder of Callaway Climate Insights, a news and information service focused on the business of climate change. The industry has now attracted more than $6 billion in funding to date, according to data from the Fusion Industry Association, with more than 40 startups aiming to become the first to commercialize nuclear fusion energy. The US government has set aside a record $1.48 billion for fusion research in the 2024 budget alone. Fusion energy has been considered a game-changer largely because of how the power source is generated. Unlike nuclear fission, which occurs when a neutron slams into a larger atom, splitting it into two, fusion occurs by taking two atoms and smashing them together to create a heavier atom. The process of fusion is equivalent to the process that powers the sun and other stars. Even more attractive to researchers, fusion doesn’t produce nuclear waste that can be weaponized. Despite the excitement around its potential, technological breakthroughs have largely been limited to government research labs – until now. In 2022 researchers at California-based Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved ignition, generating more energy than the amount of energy it took to create the fusion reaction. But that gain lasted less than one-billionth of a second. Researchers are now looking to extend that reaction, a critical move in the next step towards re-creating the energy of a star that could provide unlimited clean energy for all.

The tech giant is just one of three ""Magnificent 7"" stocks that are underperforming this year. However, KeyBanc has initiated coverage on Microsoft (MSFT) as Overweight, setting a price target of $490. Keybanc Managing Director of Software Equity Research Jackson Ader joins the Live show to discuss his call. What sets Microsoft apart from other tech names is its AI monetization abilities, Adler highlights.

""They are actually putting revenue on the board, whereas a lot of other software companies right now, it's speculation,"" Adler states.

Macquarie Senior Media Tech Analyst Tim Nollen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how AI can help advertising companies optimize their budgets. Nollen acknowledges that AI ""has been a factor for many years already"" in the advertising and media landscape. However, he also highlights the ""broader implications"" of language models like ChatGPT, which could fundamentally change how consumers perform searches. This shift could substantially impact search market revenue, which is already a $200 billion industry, Nollen explains. He notes AI could open up opportunities for advertisers who allocate ad spending to search engines, allowing them to diversify their budgets and explore alternative avenues. Nollen points to companies like AppLovin (APP) as potential beneficiaries: the company could leverage its data ""to make their automated ad buying platforms more effective,"" potentially delivering higher ""returns on spending"" for advertisers.

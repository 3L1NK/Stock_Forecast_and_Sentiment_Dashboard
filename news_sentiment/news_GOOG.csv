As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

Krishna joins the Catalyst team in-studio to talk about the refocus on AI monetization while tech stocks are trading increasingly higher than their earnings.

The major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are bouncing back after a three-day sell-off triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July. As investors continue to be wary of a recession, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok notes that despite the weak labor report, there's not much other evidence that points to a recession: ""Daily data for how many people fly on airplanes as of last Friday is still strong. Daily data from OpenTable for how many people go to restaurants is still strong. Weekly data for retail sales from Redbook is also still strong. Hotel occupancy rates, the weekly data also still strong."" He reiterates Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emphasis on the totality of the data, and adds, ""the market is overreacting to just one data point."" Note: Apollo Global Management is Yahoo's parent company. Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist Chris Watling explains, ""Sell-offs tend to happen in waves. So it's not just a straight line down, then we're done. You know, they tend to be three waves or five waves. And in the middle of that, you get these relief rallies. So it's perfectly natural that you have a very aggressive downside, a little bit of short covering, which creates a rally, which is probably what we're in now."" For investors trying to navigate the pullback, he encourages them to ""buy the bounce, trade them for a couple of weeks, go long if you're nimble, but really lighten up if you're if you're sort of multi-month investor. It all depends on your time frames. That's the challenge."" A federal judge found Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google search and advertising business to be in violation of antitrust laws. Presiding over the case levied by the Department of Justice, US District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote ""Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly."" Many experts are speculating whether this ruling over Google's search dominance could impact another tech giant: Apple (AAPL). Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley explains why this antitrust case could hurt the iPhone maker who has a revenue-sharing agreement with Google to make its search engine the default on its smartphones. Meanwhile, new earnings reports hit the market on Tuesday. Shares of Saudi Aramco (2223.SR) are trading higher after the company met second quarter net income expectations and will pay a quarterly dividend totaling $31.1 billion. Shares of Yum! Brands (YUM) are also climbing despite reporting mixed second quarter results. While the KFC and Taco Bell parent missed revenue expectations and saw same-store sales drop in those chains, its earnings topped analyst forecasts. Yum! Brands attributed the weakness to a softening consumer spending environment and Middle East tensions.

Winthrop Capital Management portfolio manager Luke Stone joins Catalysts to discuss these market dynamics. Stone observes a ""rotation narrative"" in the markets, where the Magnificent Seven stocks' valuations are considered too lofty, making it ""very hard to hit"" expectations. As this trend continues, he suggests investors may reduce their positions in these stocks and look elsewhere in the broader market for attractive opportunities. ""Investors are growing a little bit impatient that we're kicking the can down the road,"" Stone notes, referring to Big Tech names as investors wait for AI investments to yield returns. He cautions, ""all of this CapEx [capital expenditures] is great today, but if you don't have a customer base to execute on in a year from now, or if that customer base declines from worsening economic scenarios, you're going to run into issues down the road.""

Rockland Trust chief investment officer David Smith joins Catalysts to share his outlook on tech stocks. Smith notes, ""It's a data-intensive point in the season,"" with earnings reports and Federal Reserve decisions all scheduled for this week. However, following lackluster reports from companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) last week, Smith observes that ""there's very little appetite for companies that miss earnings,"" especially in the technology sector, which explains the massive sell-offs markets have seen. Regarding AI investments by Big Tech companies, Smith explains to Yahoo Finance, ""I think... AI is important to all of the Magnificent 7 in different ways, so to paint them all with the same brush is a little bit risky.""

With new economic data, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE), signaling inflation may be under control, many expect the Federal Reserve to make its first interest rate cut in September. Catalyst Funds Co-Founder and CIO David Miller joins Catalysts to give insight into what recent economic data suggests for the Fed, the tech sector, and the broader markets moving forward.    ""I think you're seeing some of this weak inflation data indicating inflation growth is actually slowing that that's giving the market more of an all-clear signal that the Fed is going to go ahead and finally do it and cut rates. So I think that's more of the response that we're seeing in equities today,"" says Miller Speaking on rotation out of tech and whether or not it should be considered a ""rout,"" he doesn't think it is, saying ""I think it's pretty unlikely that there's going to be a rout. The only real weakness we saw, for example, with Google was on the YouTube numbers that came in at 13%. But you know, we're still talking about double-digit growth. The real weakness, I guess, whether you call it auto or tech, was really more on Tesla, where you saw two sequential revenue declines, you know, totaling about 7% and real delays on whether their self-driving car service is really going to happen any time in the near future. So I think it's kind of a bit of a mixed bag, but I don't think we're in for a rout."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

The auto sector is grabbing investor attention as major companies like Stellantis (STLA) and Ford (F) report underwhelming second-quarter earnings. CarGurus director of industry insights and analytics Kevin Roberts explains that despite disappointing earnings, the auto industry is still ""quite healthy."" He notes that the earnings suggest the sector is going through ""a bit of a rebalancing right now."" The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed mixed on Thursday as they try to recover from a three-day tech sell-off. This downturn was triggered by disappointing earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) — two of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants. Yahoo Finance reporter Jared Blikre analyzes the day's top market trends, discussing the rotation into small-cap stocks and Japan's financial markets, which appear to be going through a ""capitulation."" The future of regulation for startups and big businesses rests on the 2024 election, as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have vastly different agendas. Tusk Venture Partners co-founder and managing partner Jordan Nof says that a new administration will likely bring a new leader to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ""and potentially a different posture that the FTC takes with antitrust specifically."" He notes that many investors are worried that Big Tech ""just does not want to transact right now,"" and that fear ""really takes a lot of the wind out of the sails in terms of how you can underwrite a deal to an exit."" He also explains that investors and early-stage fund managers prefer Trump-era policies compared to Biden's current policies and are most likely to vote with their pocketbooks in this election. Josh Lipton then breaks down what to watch on Friday, July 26th, before turning to some of the biggest movers in after-hours trading, from Skechers (SKX) to L3Harris Technologies (LHX).

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 — commonly referred to as the 493 — being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

RBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson joins the Morning Brief to weigh in on Alphabet's CapEx. ""Certainly they have the balance sheet and that cash flow to fund this. There is always going to be some concern. And this is just kind of more of a near-term thing,"" Erickson states, pondering: ""Is the company sort of structural return on invested capital declining?

Pras Subramanian and Dan Howley join Morning Brief to give their key takeaways from the two Magnificent Seven members' earnings calls. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company will reveal its robotaxis on October 10 after previously delaying the event. Tesla also announced that affordable EVs will start being produced in the first half of 2025. Finally, Subramanian notes that Musk was low-energy on the earnings call, making investors rather uneasy especially when he claimed he's not concerned about regulatory self-driving scrutiny. Howley notes that Alphabet shares are down because, despite beating on most metrics, YouTube ad revenue surprisingly fell short of estimates. The Google parent company spent $2.2 billion building AI models, up from $1.1 billion last year. This spending concerned some investors who are skeptical about whether these AI initiatives will be able to generate revenue. Finally, Howley notes that the cloud business is gaining steam while topping the $1 billion mark for operating profit for the first time.

The major market averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed just below their flatlines as stocks eyed second quarter earnings from Magnificent Seven members Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Google's parent Alphabet posted second quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company reported earnings per share of $1.89 versus an estimate of $1.84. Revenue of $84.74 billion topped estimates of $84.37 billion, while revenue ex-TAC of $71.36 billion was better than the Street's expectations of $70.7 billion. CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino characterizes the results as ""solid,"" but notes that the it fell short of the significant beats investors have come to expect from Big Tech, describing it as ""more of an in-line type quarter.""

Free cash flow also fell short, $1.34 billion versus the estimated $1.92 billion. Revenue, however, was a beat of $25.50 billion versus the estimated $24.63 billion.

He says that investors ""want something real"" on this front, rather than ""a bunch of PowerPoint slides."" He continues, ""When they eventually unveil this, I think they'll want details on timing, profitability, and they'll want something within six months to a year, not ten years down the road.""

Matt Stucky, Chief Portfolio Manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, advises keeping track of the trends that have been driving Big Tech stocks. Stucky mentions the ongoing health of advertising, noting that Alphabet and Meta (META) have the opportunity to take advantage of the improving ad environment. Stucky continues by discussing how strong fundamentals are more relevant than valuations in the short run, considering the upcoming earnings and their influence over the market. He concedes, ""It's not until you start to see revision trends rollover that’s where the valuation concerns really come into the investor mindset."" When asked about where investors should look to invest their money within tech, Stucky notes that he is not advising clients to blindly dump money into mega-cap tech. Instead, he suggests keeping a long-term investment horizon while continuing to diversify their portfolio, using small-cap stocks as an example. Switching gears to CrowdStrike (CRWD) and cybersecurity as a whole, Stucky explains the prominence of security as a cemented trend year after year. He uses the recent crash as an example of the necessity of IT resilience and the potential for further spending in the IT sector.

So I want to be highly selective here,"" Mahaney explains. He is bullish on Alphabet because of its product cycle and growth in its YouTube platform, also pointing to Uber (UBER) as his number two pick, ""I think we just had some dislocation in the stock recently over fears of robotaxis and how that could disrupt ridesharing. I don't think it will. I think robotaxis will be part of the ridesharing solution."" On the other hand, Mahaney does not have Amazon in his top three list of tech stocks despite maintaining its Buy rating.

Catalysts welcomes on Evercore ISI managing director and head of internet research Mark Mahaney to talk about upcoming Big Tech earnings, particularly Alphabet's. ""On the consumer side, whether the Google search results are perceived to be better, more relevant than they were in the past, and we've done our own survey work on this... and so far, we have found that consumers find the results from Gemini and AI overviews to be better than what they had before. And they're responding by doing more searches,"" Mahaney states. ""On the advertiser side... our checks have kind of indicated that the quality of the leads coming out of Google search is slightly improved. If that's true, and if that's sustained, that's what advertisers care about,"" he adds. ""And so if you can maintain that or even improve that, you've got a chance for kind of a double-barreled boost to Google search revenue, both in terms of query volumes and in terms of improved return on ad spend for which advertisers were willing to spend more."" Mahaney also names Uber (UBER) as his number two pick in tech, finding robotaxis will be ""part of the rode-sharing solution."" He also discusses his position on Shopify (SHOP) and Amazon (AMZN).

Spear Invest founder and CIO Ivana Delevska joins Market Domination to give insight into the current performance of the tech sector (XLK) and inform investors know what to keep in mind moving forward. Deleveska argues that Big Tech isn't going anywhere because, to truly implement AI in these businesses, it will take considerable investments.  Using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms' (META) products as examples, she states: ""As we go forward, it's going to take 2 to 3 years to see real applications come through. We are already seeing it on the early side with customer service and productivity improvement tools that are really leveraging the large language models, but the next level, the next layer of opportunity, will be in the physical, like robotics, autonomous driving, and that's going to take a little bit longer to play out. Nevertheless, you do need to make the investments today in compute to be able to advance these applications even a little bit.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sunk by 512 points — or 2.77% — in Wednesday's trading session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also closed 1.39% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) saw a 0.60% bump higher to a new record high. Markets have taken a turn as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) makes gains while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lag from pressure facing the chip sector. Kestra Investment Management CIO Kara Murphy says, ""If you look at over the last six months, 80% of the constituents of the S&P 500 have underperformed the index... Now all of a sudden, we get a couple of good inflation prints, a couple good labor prints. Looks like Fed can start to cut interest rates, and all of a sudden, the macro environment starts to change. And I think this is a hint of what is going to turn out to be a broader trend."" She encourages investors to start rotating out some mega-cap names for some smaller-cap and mid-cap names, explaining that with mid-caps, ""you have companies that are a little bit more established, a little bit more mature, a little bit more diversified, better balance sheets in general, but largely ignored by a lot of the market."" United Airlines (UAL) posted mixed second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.14 topped estimates of $3.93. Operating revenue of $15.0 billion was about in line with the estimated $15.04 billion, but passenger revenue of $13.68 billion was just shy of the expected $13.74 billion. The airliner disappointed with its third quarter outlook, projecting adjusted earnings of $2.75 to $3.25 per share, coming in below the anticipated $3.38. Third Bridge global sector lead for industrials, materials, and energy Peter McNally explains, ""most of the market has gotten this heads up now that the airline industry is softening. There's just too much capacity right now and we're at a peak demand season. And it's weighing on the revenues outlook."" He adds, ""it gets more interesting for United longer term,"" as capital expenditures seem lower year-over-year and Boeing's (BA) deliveries slow. He notes that United's future plans depend on getting new planes from Boeing, and he's keeping a watchful eye on how those plans get pushed.

The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has risen by more than 10% in the last five trading sessions, marking the longest streak of gains for the small-cap index since April 2020. MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Chris Grisanti believes that small caps are still ""underpriced"" despite the Russell 2000 having ""its biggest move in terms of standard deviations that we've seen in more than 30 years over the last week."" He adds that small-cap stocks are cheap buying opportunities: ""I don't think it's too late to initiate positions if you haven't already."" Retail stocks are on the move as shares of Five Below (FIVE) sink nearly 20% after the retailer announced its CEO Joel Anderson is resigning. The retailer also lowered its second quarter guidance. Meanwhile, shares of Vans parent company VF Corporation (VFC) are jumping on reports that the apparel company will be selling its Supreme brand to European eyewear brand EssilorLuxottica (EL.PA, ESLOY) for $1.5 billion.

""We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations.

He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI)close at a record high in Monday's session, closing 0.53% higher. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ended the day in the green, slightly below their record closes. The S&P 500 hit an all-time high intraday. Former President Donald Trump has announced Senator JD Vance (R-Oh.) as his vice presidential pick just days after surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Unlimited co-founder, CEO, and CIO Bob Elliott notes that following the assassination attempt, the odds of Trump winning the election have increased. He explains, ""What we're seeing is actually gold (GC=F) as one of the best-performing assets in the market, reflective of the fact that we're likely to get large deficits ahead as the Republicans have a higher probability of controlling all three chambers of the US government. We're seeing bonds sell off as a function of growth likely being stronger and having those larger deficits and higher inflation."" Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is in talks to acquire cyber security startup Wiz for $23 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill is excited by the deal, stating: ""I think this makes a lot more sense given that they [Wiz] can address both small, mid, and large enterprises with this technology. That the government — there's zero chance, in my opinion, they could push back on this because it's enabling the security and safety of data, and no one has dominant market share, so it makes a lot of sense for us...

As AI competition from Big Tech names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) heat up, can Musk's new company keep up or will it eclipse them entirely? Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton joins Asking for a Trend to discuss why he is invested in xAI and believes Musk has an interesting point of view when it comes to advocating for new tech ideas, like artificial intelligence. ""I think you have to really have a deep respect for figuring out... the sciences, figuring out physics. And if you think about who in the world has done the most to figure out things, physical problems like we just talked about, it's Tesla, it's SpaceX, and it's Elon. And so I think he's probably in a different and more unique position than some of these other companies, like a Google, like an OpenAI, who are great in the digital space, but they're sort of amateurs in the physical space.

Now Amazon (AMZN) wants to own the chips that power its cloud and boost profits by gaining share in the chips market, currently led by Nvidia (NVDA). Yahoo Finance got an exclusive first look at AWS’s latest chip, called the Graviton4. What makes this latest chip special? It’s the most powerful and efficient AWS chip to date. It’s 35% faster than the prior generation and has 75% more memory bandwidth. It’s the latest example of the research and development tech firms are willing to pour into chip development. AI is fueling demand for semiconductors - the guts that power the AI boom - meaning companies have to build those guts at a record-breaking pace. Whoever does it the fastest stands to grab up chip juggernaut Nvidia's market share - currently 80% of the GPU chips market. That’s fueling a race between tech and chips companies, not only fueled by competition but also propelled by government incentives designed to fight back against China and have the United States retake the lead as the world’s dominant global chip manufacturer. Can AWS get a larger slice of the chips market pie? Here’s what’s next in the chips race. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT in the business of neurotechnology.

Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as ""gatekeepers."" Meta was identified by the Commission as a ""gatekeeper"" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, ""I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model."" He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a ""slap on the wrist"" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): ""Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

New home sales for the month of May fell over 11%, according to the US Census Bureau. KPMG senior economist Yelena Maleyev claims that it will be a while before the housing sector sees relief, only estimating one interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve by December: ""We've pushed that forecast out into December, so we do expect one rate cut in December, which will help bring overall mortgage rates to perhaps around 6.5 by the end of the year. That's probably not what people who are waiting for those 3% mortgage rates are wanting to hear, but unfortunately, those days are behind us."" She adds that a few more rate cuts in the pipeline could bring mortgage rates to 5.5%. US equity markets have hit record highs in 2024, largely spearheaded by the growth of semiconductor and chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). BlackRock US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs Jay Jacobs sits down with Brad Smith on Wealth! as part of Yahoo Finance's ETF Report to discuss several of BlackRock's notable iShares ETFs in relation to the growing AI landscape and the energy and digital infrastructure demands that come with mass adoption. The number of US households with direct stock ownership increased by 6% between 2019 and 2022, according to a Federal Reserve study of consumer finances. JPMorgan Wealth Management head of self-directed investing Andrea Finan says her biggest tip for beginner investors is to ""find the experts ... Go to credentialized places to get information and learn. I really strive for people to become curious in investing and learn and use the tools..."" Finally, as more than 24 million people are expected to fly out of US airports during the 4th of July weekend, Hopper Lead Economist Hayley Berg gives an overview of thee busy weekend ahead. She explains that summer travel prices have decreased, as airfares are down 18% in the US and hotel and rental car prices remain in line with previous years: ""So those travelers who are getting away are definitely able to expand those travel budgets into things like activities and maybe some nice dinners out rather than spending as much on accommodations and flights.""

Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the 2024 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity to discuss where sports streaming fits into the broader game plan for major streaming service providers. Mayer calls sports and news ""the last bastion of pay TV"" with the future of linear television mainly coming down to sports. ""The outlook for pay television isn't great, and when sports viewers find other opportunities to watch sports, I think you'll see a continuation of that decline and a collapse, frankly, of that environment,"" Mayer says. ""But broadcast is a bit different. That doesn't depend on pay TV to get delivered to households there in every single household. And I do think you'll just see a different type of programming coming on there."" Mayer's resume also includes his tenure as the CEO of TikTok, COO of the popular app's parent company ByteDance, and the chairman of Disney's (DIS) Direct-to-Consumer & International segment.

Needham & Company senior entertainment and internet analyst Laura Martin raised her price target for the company from $63 to $75, citing its new AI deal and more. Martin joins Catalysts to give insight into her call and explain her belief that the social media company has more room to grow. Martin argues Reddit will gain even more from future deals with other tech companies: ""So the margins here are 90% when they do one of these licensing deals and they already have a $200 million deal with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) ... And then they just got another $200 million deal from OpenAI, Sam Altman's company that Microsoft (MSFT) is the big investor in. I expect all the Amazon (AMZN) large language models and the Meta (META) large language models to also license the Reddit conversations to keep up with changing English real quickly.""

Dr. Angela Shippy, medical doctor-turned-physician executive at Amazon Web Services, is leading the charge at the world's biggest cloud provider. Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) added $16 billion to their 2024 capex on AI spending this earnings season, a 31% increase from last year. Part of that capital is spent on healthcare, in an effort to target what many see as a broken system that has suffered from long-standing problems that were further exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic. “If we can take away those tiny administrative burdensome tasks and allow them to do what they truly love,” Dr. Shippy said, “then we know we're making it a better experience for them, and we're making it a better experience for the patient as well because they're in control.”Dr. Shippy is leveraging her background as a practicing clinician to inform her work as the Clinical Innovation Lead for healthcare at AWS. In her role, she connects with 700 healthcare providers across the country as they integrate AWS-powered tech solutions into their practices. While 56% of hospitals’ total operating revenue goes toward labor, the field is also challenged with managing labor shortages and increased patient volumes. Dr. Shippy aims to address these issues by deploying devices like Amazon Alexa to empower patients to make requests like turning a light on and off while reducing pressure on staff. Yahoo Finance gets a closer look at how Dr. Shippy is driving AWS’s next cloud revolution in healthcare and her plan for how AI will create a more equitable healthcare system overall.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=77bf4501a6b750f6022275274c1cf08371986d742cab8db99ed41fb227eff409

128179309,2024-06-10,14:12:31,2024-06-10 14:12:31,"YF Reports: AI Chip Wars: Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, & AMD","All this week, business leaders in the chip industry gathered at the COMPUTEX Conference in Tapei, Taiwan; all with the stated purpose of showing off their companies latest products and developments. Current industry front runner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled its most impressive next-generation AI chip, nicknamed Rubin. Meanwhile AMD (AMD) announced their AMD Instict MI325X accelerator, showing how the company plans on leading the AI space in performance and memory. Intel (INTC) plans on finding their own niche in the heavily sought after market, announcing their new Gaudi 3 AI Chips; a more affordable option for cost-conscious customers. As the AI revolution heats up, who will come out on top of the AI Chip Wars. Here is what you need to know: Nvidia is the undisputed heavy-weight in the AI space. Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita explains: ""Tough to argue with anybody being the big winner except Nvidia so far when you consider the sheer scale of they've been able to accomplish. When you talk about data center revenue alone, the category that has seen the biggest bump from the AI boom, rose 427% from a year ago in it's most recent quarter."" Nvidia may have won the battle, but they have not yet won the war. Competitors like AMD & Intel are making aggressive inroads. I/O Fund Lead Analyst Beth Kindig breaks it down: ""In this AI battle, this AI competition between AMD and Nvidia, I estimate that AMD is capable of taking somewhere between 10% to maximum 20% of the market. This is based on the gaming competition these two companies have had for some time. Intel, they are moving well past 20%. Intel is an easier competitor than Nvidia. I think Nvidia is going to be a tougher competitor for AMD.""  Even though Nvidia dominates the AI space, no market wants to rely on only one company. KeyBlanc Capital Markets Analyst John Vinh discusses why Nvidia's monopoly in the microchip industry is a cause for concern, and a clear sign of opportunity for other companies to wrestle back some of the lion share from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. ""The market is really badly looking for a credible second source to Nvidia. Nvidia is making 90% gross margins on its AI chips and the industry badly, badly wants are credible second source on the emergence side."" One company that is setting their target on the emergence side is Intel. At COMPUTEX they unveiled the new Gaudi 3 AI Chip, a more affordable option for companies who want to dip their toes in the emerging generative-AI market, but who may be scared off by the high price point of Nvida or AMD. Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley discusses: ""Now Intel, they announced their Gaudi Chip pricing, which they say is going to come in less than what you would see from Nvidia. The hyperscalers: the Microsoft's the Google's, they're all in on Nvidia at this point. This will allow for other companies outside of hyperscalers to get into generative-AI at a potentially lower price. It's healthcare, it's individual research institutes, it's automotive industries. That is where Intel could really shine."" Another dark horse in these AI Chip wars is Qualcomm (QCOM). They have set their sights on making powerful computer processors able to handle artificial intelligence features. Microsoft took notice, partnering with the San Diego based company on the release of their new Surface Laptops and Surface Pro Tablets. Dan Howley continues: ""If you look at what Microsoft did, they used Qualcomm chips to launch this new category of computers, and that's a big deal. That means they have full faith in what Qualcomm can do.""  This post was written by Noah Chadwick",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=583b8ea9d3375595b346b52a3ae79c09b3728e8e70652f0ad2570e3bbffe6a49

Rocks,"As the world’s largest companies scramble to tackle the impacts of climate change, Big Tech is betting on a surprisingly low-tech solution to reach their net-zero goal. Enhanced rock weathering already happens naturally over thousands of years, but startup Lithos Carbon is accelerating the process, spreading leftover rock dust across farm fields. The company is scaling its operation with financial backing from Frontier, a consortium of investors that include Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and JPMorgan (JPM). The climate fund, led by payments processing company Stripe, committed $57.1 million to Lithos Carbon last year to remove over 154,000 tons of carbon. Lithos Carbon is one of hundreds of startups globally that are competing in a carbon removal industry expected to reach $135 billion by 2040, according to consulting firm BCG. Once considered a workaround for critical emission-cutting work, carbon removal technologies, which extract and sequester carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, are increasingly seen as a necessary step to capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, as laid out in the Paris Agreement. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the world needs to remove up to 10 billion tons of carbon per year by the middle of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Roughly 2,400 companies have disclosed having net-zero targets in place, according to nonprofit group CDP. Many of those firms are turning to carbon removal technologies to offset emissions, as they realize that emissions reductions alone won’t get them within their net-zero goals. Demand for carbon credits is projected to quadruple from 2030 to 2040, according to BCG. Big Tech firms are among the biggest buyers of carbon removal credits. Microsoft (MSFT), the leading buyer globally, has purchased more than 7.6 million carbon credits, since 2020 according to online tracker CDR.fyi.

In 2023 alone, the Google parent generated over $307 billion in revenue, and its market cap is currently pegged at more than $2 trillion. Beyond the Ticker takes a closer look at the company's biggest moments. 1996 Alphabet began as a research project by Stanford University students Larry Page and Sergey Brin called ""Backrub"". The duo soon changed the name to Google. 1998 The company purchased the Google.com domain and officially incorporated. 2000 Google began selling advertising through Google AdWords, helping to power the company’s revenue moving forward. 2001 Google brought on Eric Schmidt as CEO to grow the company into a tech powerhouse. 2004 The company launched Gmail, which quickly gained popularity thanks to its 1 GB of free storage. On August 19, 2004, Google went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq at $85 per share, valuing the company at $23 billion. 2005 Google purchased struggling mobile phone software company Android for $50 million, eventually turning it into the most popular mobile operating system in the world. 2006 The company acquired popular internet video company YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock. 2011 Schmidt stepped down as CEO of Google, taking on the role of executive chairman of the board. He resigned from that position in 2018 and left the board entirely in 2019. 2015 Google created a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc., to oversee its various entities including Google itself, as well as companies like Nest, X Development, and Fiber. Sundar Pichai, who then worked as head of Google’s products, became CEO of Google. 2019 Pichai took on the role of CEO of Alphabet. 2024 Alphabet continues to thrive, reaching a new all-time high stock closing price of $177.85 on May 21, 2024. Alphabet is now riding the AI hype train into the future, as it spreads the technology across its massive collection of apps and services.

SOCi CEO Afif Khoury joins Asking For a Trend to discusses the study's methodology and findings. Khoury elaborates on the findings: ""The spin on it may currently not be in favor of GPT in the sense that, generative AI tools, they have access to the internet. So GPT has access to this local data as much as Bing or Google do because it's public, publicly found information, but it does come down to how they write their algorithms and what they prioritize and Google has been in the local game for a long time and heavily prioritizes that data. So I wouldn't say it's unfair in that different companies have access to different information, but if when you pick a certain topic, some may be better than others for that topic, depending on what they prioritize.""

Big tech companies like Meta (META) are backing research into this field, including products that can decode thoughts without requiring surgery. The big question: what does our world look like if big tech companies can read your mind? Tech companies are building off neurotech advancements in the medical world. Meta is backing a team of neuroscientists whose research uncovered nonsurgical ways to detect brain activity and speech to interpret your thoughts. In 2022, Apple (AAPL) also filed a patent for AirPods that uses EEG technology to measure biosignals and electrical activity of a user's brain. Noninvasive mind reading can be revolutionary in medicine for patients - it can also be used by big tech for consumer-facing products that put privacy at risk. Neurorights advocates believe our thoughts are the last piece of data we have left to ourselves. That’s why they are now fighting for legislation that would safeguard our mental privacy while tech companies continue funding brain-scanning research. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT in the business of neurotechnology.

With the US leveraging a potential ban against TikTok if its parent company ByteDance doesn't divest from it, how can these tech giants stir up even tighter competition if a ban ends up going through? MikMak CEO Rachel Tipograph joins Catalysts to discuss her company's findings from ad revenue data and the power TikTok holds in the business world. Tipograph explains: ""TikTok is typically now around our second most trafficked social platform. It goes Meta, then TikTok, then an environment like YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and then X is irrelevant. I share this because I'm not seeing brands pull back from TikTok. I think right now they're actually trying to put their pedal on the gas while TikTok's around. TikTok is an amazing channel to drive consumer growth. We're seeing it in beauty, we're starting to see it in grocery."" She then affirms: ""If TikTok was to go away, Meta would win, YouTube would win, CTV would win. TikTok is really a play of brand awareness and video, and so those dollars would just get reallocated.""

The company has also utilized AI to improve personalized recommendations for its users. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita are joined by Pinterest CEO Bill Ready at the Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss the impact of new deals from tech giants.

To dissect the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on earnings, Market Domination Overtime welcomes The Transcript Editor and Founder of Avondale Asset Management Scott Krisiloff. Krisiloff acknowledges the first quarter earnings season has been stronger than expected, with consumers demonstrating resilience in the face of economic headwinds. However, a major theme that has emerged throughout the earnings reports is the crucial role of AI. Krisiloff notes that the tech companies with significant AI plays ""are in one bucket,"" while the rest of the Fortune 500 corporations ""very interested"" in AI's potential to drive business growth and enhance their operations. He also notes how companies discussed how power-hungry AI systems are. ""I think what we're seeing with AI is that it's this massive tool that's being built for humanity that has the potential to multiply economic output to levels that we haven't seen before, but, in order to do that, it's very energy-intensive,"" Krisiloff explains.

Some of the reports announced plans for major capital expenditures toward the development of AI projects. Niles Investment Management Founder Dan Niles joins Catalysts to explore how tech giants benefit from each other's earnings reports, as well as the market's reaction to tech earnings. ""Meta came out first, and they guided below the Street for next quarter's revenues, but then they took up their cap-x as well as their expenses. Google came out after that, and remember, Meta went down 11%, and Google initiated a dividend, which was great, but if you look at the forward numbers, actually, the estimates across the Street actually edged down for revenues for their upcoming June quarter as well. So, I think to some extent, Google benefitted from Meta going first, and if you look at Microsoft, sort of a similar situation, where the stock was up, I think, 2% or so the next day, but again, they came after Meta, and Microsoft's forward revenue numbers edged down slightly as well,"" Niles explained.

Against this backdrop, Advisors Capital Management Partner and Portfolio Manager JoAnne Feeney joins Wealth! to discuss how investors should navigate the market. Feeney notes that earnings results from Big Tech names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) have enabled the markets to sustain their upward momentum despite a Federal Reserve rate cut not yet materializing. Many of these companies are ""on track to grow"" on the back of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, she adds.  Feeney acknowledges that ""there's a lot of mixed information coming out of the markets,"" emphasizing the importance of investing in individual stocks instead of taking a broad approach. Although the Fed hasn't cut rates, she describes it as a ""good news story"" because the economy remains strong, and earnings continue to grow. ""What you have to do is not look at the market as a whole, but look at individual companies with strong demand drivers that are in the right place in the market for how the world is changing,"" Feeney tells Yahoo Finance.

The big takeaway from both reports? That generative artificial intelligence is here and companies are spending on it, says both Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson and RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst Rishi Jaluria. ""The commentary out of both Google and Microsoft, I think, tells us that there is real demand for AI... there's actual money being put behind this. It's not just hype. It's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work,"" Jaluria tells Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. Mortonson agrees. ""We are going through, really, a generational infrastructure build,"" Mortonson says, adding that both Microsoft and Alphabet have an ""advantage"" because their ""data center footprint already exists."" Jaluria notes that investors ""will be patient"" with Microsoft's big spending on infrastructure as long as the company's AI-related businesses continue to show growth. As to why investors were less happy about Meta's (META) AI spending, Mortonson thinks it may come down to ""a game of positioning."" ""Meta was extremely crowded going into the print. There's some people that, quite frankly, didn't like some of the unprofitable spend,"" Mortonson says. He believes that Meta is ""very attractive"" given how hard the stock was hit by its results, but the Microsoft does have a ""huge advantage"" due to its enterprise business.

Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan and Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Strategist Ben Bajarin joined Market Domination to discuss the potential impact of artificial intelligence on Big Tech earnings. Bajarin highlights two main concerns: ""Who's getting the most beneficiary lift from AI stocks?"" and ""Do we have outsized expectations of AI growth?"" However, he believes tech earnings will see strong growth due to AI infrastructure investments. Bajarin expresses worry about potential volatility stemming from ""the bubble-ish cycle of AI."" He also notes that costs associated with AI innovation could be a factor affecting earnings. Morgan emphasizes that if investors look beyond the AI hype, Big Tech is ""looking at very strong growth"" across the core business models. While companies like AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) do have substantial profit growth fueled by AI, Morgan notes that for earnings from names like Microsoft and Meta there won't be ""a huge AI effect, in terms of like 30% growth coming from AI, but their core businesses are very strong."" He adds that if the Federal Reserve were to refrain from cutting rates and inflation remains elevated, these tech giants ""are delivering growth regardless of what the Fed is doing.""

TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to break down the recent movements in the tech sector and how its major players can operate moving forward. O'Donnell talks about potential leaders in tech for the long-term: ""The one thing is, Nvidia's got 90% share. Anybody who's got 90% share is going to lose a little share. But, that doesn't mean they still can't grow organically from where they are. You're just going to see a lot more competitors.

126774099,2024-04-01,09:55:34,2024-04-01 09:55:34,Exclusive: Fusion reactor promises limitless energy,"Fusion energy has long been hailed as the holy grail because of its potential for limitless amounts of clean energy. But that promise has trailed reality for decades, with billions of dollars in research leading to few breakthroughs. Now there’s optimism that is about to change, partly because of new startups funded by the likes of Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates. Yahoo Finance went inside the country’s largest magnetic fusion facility for an exclusive look, to explore the challenges of bringing this technology to commercial use for the latest episode of NEXT. “The race is on to actually see who can develop this and who can get it to the masses the fastest,” said David Callaway, former editor-in-chief of USA Today and founder of Callaway Climate Insights, a news and information service focused on the business of climate change. The industry has now attracted more than $6 billion in funding to date, according to data from the Fusion Industry Association, with more than 40 startups aiming to become the first to commercialize nuclear fusion energy. The US government has set aside a record $1.48 billion for fusion research in the 2024 budget alone. Fusion energy has been considered a game-changer largely because of how the power source is generated. Unlike nuclear fission, which occurs when a neutron slams into a larger atom, splitting it into two, fusion occurs by taking two atoms and smashing them together to create a heavier atom. The process of fusion is equivalent to the process that powers the sun and other stars. Even more attractive to researchers, fusion doesn’t produce nuclear waste that can be weaponized. Despite the excitement around its potential, technological breakthroughs have largely been limited to government research labs – until now. In 2022 researchers at California-based Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved ignition, generating more energy than the amount of energy it took to create the fusion reaction. But that gain lasted less than one-billionth of a second. Researchers are now looking to extend that reaction, a critical move in the next step towards re-creating the energy of a star that could provide unlimited clean energy for all.

Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani — who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share — joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of. Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses ""more headline risk than fundamental risk,"" stating that he doesn't believe it has ""a material impact"" on Apple. However, he suggests that how ""elements in the US play out"" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as ""an AI story."" He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good ""value [proposition]"" for the company's stock.

Macquarie Senior Media Tech Analyst Tim Nollen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how AI can help advertising companies optimize their budgets. Nollen acknowledges that AI ""has been a factor for many years already"" in the advertising and media landscape. However, he also highlights the ""broader implications"" of language models like ChatGPT, which could fundamentally change how consumers perform searches. This shift could substantially impact search market revenue, which is already a $200 billion industry, Nollen explains. He notes AI could open up opportunities for advertisers who allocate ad spending to search engines, allowing them to diversify their budgets and explore alternative avenues. Nollen points to companies like AppLovin (APP) as potential beneficiaries: the company could leverage its data ""to make their automated ad buying platforms more effective,"" potentially delivering higher ""returns on spending"" for advertisers.

The likelihood of the bill passing through the Senate and landing on President Biden's desk has been called into question considering the timing of the presidential election and the usual slow reaction time from the Senate. Wolfe Research Head of US Policy and Politics Tobin Marcus joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the bill and what are the most likely next steps through Congress and beyond. When asked if it will ever get through the Senate and be signed into law, Marcus claims: ""I think the realistic avenue for getting this done is the next annual defense policy bill, the so-called NDAA for FY [Fiscal Year] '25, which will get done sometimes after the election... that's a bill that happens every year, sort of one of the last bona fide bipartisan things that gets done.

Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up.

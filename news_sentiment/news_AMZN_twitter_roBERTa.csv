Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner joins Wealth! to discuss the state of the tech industry sa recession fears circulate. If July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes in higher than expected and interest rates start to come down, Wagner argues that the Magnificent Seven will ""continue to be that funding mechanism, much like what we saw in the middle of July."" ""You saw that capital flow from the Magnificent Seven to some of the smaller-cap cohorts to more of the real estate investment trust areas, the utilities, and even some of the more consumer cyclical and the consumer discretionary area,"" he says. Wagner notes that the flow of capital will remain with the Magnificent Seven because ""there's so much resiliency, there's so much pricing in elasticity that a lot of those companies have."" While the safe move 10 years ago was to invest in staples like utilities, Wagner believes it is now in AI tech names: ""The amount of profit margin and operating leverage that a lot of these Magnificent Seven companies have, that's where the flow of capital is going to go if investors are looking for safety. And so if you think that there's going to be volatility in the market, not just here in the near term, but over say the next three to four months, I'd be putting my capital in the Mag Seven.""

As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

Built like humans and fueled by artificial intelligence, the machines are learning to tackle complicated tasks at a rapid rate. The advancement of generative AI is supercharging how quickly humanoids can learn, backed by vast amounts of data and high-powered chips. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has doubled down on its future, building out an ecosystem that enables robotics makers to customize their products. The Isaac robotics platform, which includes generative AI foundation models and tools, allow developers to simulate real- world movements in the digital world, while Nvidia’s Thor system-on-a-chip (SOC) provides the computing power needed to drive the transformation. Already, Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and others are incorporating humanoids in their work spaces. At a recent shareholder meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the machines had the potential to propel the EV maker into a $25 trillion market cap company. Tesla is looking to capture the market by integrating its Optimus humanoid into factory floors. Musk has said two robots have already been deployed at the company’s Fremont, California factory and predicted “a few thousand” Optimus robots to be working by 2025. But the company faces plenty of competition. Austin-based Apptronik has already signed partnerships with logistics firm GXO and Mercedes-Benz to deploy its humanoids to their floors, while Amazon has begun using Agility’s Digit robot in its test facility. Watch to see what’s NEXT in humanoid robots. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT.

Krishna joins the Catalyst team in-studio to talk about the refocus on AI monetization while tech stocks are trading increasingly higher than their earnings.

""But clearly as the focus changes on onto the monetization of AI, from here on you don't want to pay very high multiples and you want to see actually the monetization showing up in earnings. And clearly this is a secular trend...""

D.A. Davidson senior software analyst Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss the market movement and his top tech stock picks despite the dip. ""There's traders selling because they're covering their yen carry trade. There's computer algorithmic trading that's selling because those traders sold. And then there's index fund computers that are selling because those two sold. What's not happening is somebody didn't wake up this morning and say Apple, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) are worth 5% less than they were on Friday. That's not happening,"" Luria explains. He says that fundamental-based investors haven't changed their minds since Friday, and the prospects for large cap tech companies will continue to do well. He adds that there are companies out there that will benefit from AI over the next few years, and that value is not yet reflected in the stock price. He points to Apple as one of those companies as a buying opportunity, explaining its AI integration will drive an iPhone upgrade cycle. He also points to Amazon as another opportunity, noting that its AWS (Amazon Web Services) segment has more room to grow as it strengthens its AI capabilities.

Winthrop Capital Management portfolio manager Luke Stone joins Catalysts to discuss these market dynamics. Stone observes a ""rotation narrative"" in the markets, where the Magnificent Seven stocks' valuations are considered too lofty, making it ""very hard to hit"" expectations. As this trend continues, he suggests investors may reduce their positions in these stocks and look elsewhere in the broader market for attractive opportunities. ""Investors are growing a little bit impatient that we're kicking the can down the road,"" Stone notes, referring to Big Tech names as investors wait for AI investments to yield returns. He cautions, ""all of this CapEx [capital expenditures] is great today, but if you don't have a customer base to execute on in a year from now, or if that customer base declines from worsening economic scenarios, you're going to run into issues down the road.""

Smith notes, ""It's a data-intensive point in the season,"" with earnings reports and Federal Reserve decisions all scheduled for this week. However, following lackluster reports from companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) last week, Smith observes that ""there's very little appetite for companies that miss earnings,"" especially in the technology sector, which explains the massive sell-offs markets have seen. Regarding AI investments by Big Tech companies, Smith explains to Yahoo Finance, ""I think...

JPMorgan US head of investment strategy Jake Manoukian joins Morning Brief to give insight into Big Tech earnings and what investors need to know about the tech sector going forward. Manoukian believes that while the initial AI hype might be decreasing for some, the market is still witnessing the early innings of AI development: ""What gives us comfort as investors is these companies, these hyperscalers are driving this investment through cash flow. This is very different than the kind of internet boom in the 2000's when companies had to take capital from investors, take capital from the bond market to build out the internet. AI cap-ex from the for biggest hyperscalers is going to be $200 billion this year. Last year they did $270 billion in free cash flow."" The analyst believes this balance will allow companies the ""wiggle room to actually build the ballpark"" of AI.

What is helping this rotation and is it just a short term movement? Liz Young Thomas SoFi head of investment strategy joins Market Domination to give insight into Big Tech earnings and what investors need to know during this current economic cycle. In terms of how investors are moving during this notion of a rotation, Young Thomas states: ""I think what's going on actually right now with the rotation is that some of those big cap tech names have given some back, because when people look at their portfolios, that is the easiest stuff to sell. You've got a big gain in it. It's a very liquid name, professional investors see those as easy to sell as well. So it's an easy place to take some profits and rotate.

Investors will be watching the results closely following some mixed results from Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL). Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Bryant VanCronkhite joins Wealth! to give insight into the upcoming tech earnings from Big Tech names and what investors should keep in mind moving forward. VanCronkhite explains that though the AI trade has fueled the market gains, right now, the developments aren't really showing up in quarterly results, leaving some investors questioning when it will happen. In terms of the tech sector, and the rotation into small caps that has been seen in markets the last few weeks, VanCronkhite states: ""I've been calling for this value rotation going back a couple of weeks now, and it's starting to play out well. There could be more legs to this, and it makes a lot of sense. With the amount of money being concentrated in a narrow market, we only get there for one of two reasons. We either get there because of greed or exuberance, which we have today around the AI trade, or you get there out of fear. When you're worried about the overall economy, maybe the Fed being late to react, pushing us into a recession, you want to get more and more capital around a fewer and fewer set of companies where you have the most visibility."" He continues with: ""So both fear and greed have pushed capital into a narrow market, but those will both get resolved eventually. And I think that the cool inflation prints is giving the market the belief the Fed can begin to act, giving them the chance to jump through that ever closing window to avoid a recession. And as that happens, the natural rotation is out of the concentrate names into the value trade into the broader markets.""

Discovery's (WBD) filed a lawsuit against the NBA after it rejected the media giant's matching offer to maintain the rights to broadcast and stream games after next season. Sportsimpacts CEO Patrick Rishe joins Asking for a Trend to break down the news and how it will impact the media giant. ""I suspect that ultimately one of two things will happen: Either the NBA will win this case and Discovery and Turner will no longer cover NBA games after this season Or, there could be some compromise and maybe a fourth tier of games is packaged to allow them to come back in and still be part of the equation,"" Rishe explains. He calls WBD passing on making a bid in the first place a ""calculated risk"" — especially as the NBA ""recognizes that streaming is the future in bringing in younger fans."" With this emphasis on streaming, Rishe suspects that it was the primary motivation for going with the Amazon (AMZN) bid.

Piper Sandler senior research analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer joins Market Domination to discuss her reasoning behind the call and how it is faring against other big names in the beauty industry. Wolfmeyer points to Ulta's promotions as a ""reaction to the competitive intensity we've seen over the past several months and even years, both from brick-and-mortar retail peers such as Sephora that's really ramped up its store count with its partnership with Kohl's (KSS), but also with online players like Amazon (AMZN) that's really ramped up its prestige beauty offering and seen a lot more brands feel comfortable selling on digital platforms like Amazon."" She notes that this competition has placed Ulta under pressure, and that ""there's a lot less confidence in the margin opportunity going forward."" She adds that Amazon is a ""threat to everybody,"" as it has a wide offering of products. Wolfmeyer explains that Ulta has a mass offering larger than Sephora, so it may be losing some share to Amazon. While Ulta's target demographic is broad-based, she argues that overall, customers are ""diversifying where they're shopping, and they want to shop at all the different retailers. They don't want to stay loyal to just one."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

""If a brand doesn't have exposure to the retailers or the areas that are gaining share, then they are going to lose,"" Wolfmeyer says. She notes that many beauty companies are increasingly offering their products in high-growth avenues, like on Amazon's e-commerce site (AMZN). She adds, ""We're seeing the brands shift where they're selling and really going after where those high growth categories and distributors are."" Wolfmeyer points to e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) as one of her top picks in the beauty industry, noting that the company has seen unprecedented growth and strong margins. She believes that investors are undervaluing the international opportunity for the company, as well as its ability to capture the consumer. ""The consumer is becoming less loyal and so they need that newness. They need something constantly innovating and hitting them and really targeting them through all facets of marketing tactics. And that's what e.l.f. does,"" She explains that the company has ""heavy innovation"" and ""very agile marketing strategies"" that make it stand out against its competitors. E.l.f.

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 — commonly referred to as the 493 — being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

With other consumer brands yet to report their earnings, Gradient Investments portfolio manager Keith Gangl joins Market Domination to discuss the state of consumer spending and some of his top stock picks amid the current economic backdrop. ""Coke had a good pricing and their mix was 9% up. That's very good. If you go back last year, all of Coke's EPS [earnings per share] growth was from pricing, right? Inflation went up. They passed on the price to consumers. Now, the good thing for the consumer side of things is they're not passing it all on price. They're also using volumes actually adding as well,"" Gangl explains. He notes that high-end consumers are doing well while lower-end consumers struggle. He is bullish on Amazon (AMZN) as a way to play both the consumer and tech sides of the market. Specifically on the consumer side, he points to Amazon's investments into capital expenditures (CapEx) that are starting to pay off as margins increase. He also points to McDonald's (MCD) as a company to watch as its value meals have the ability to draw consumers back in. As investors await the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut, Gangl believes that homebuilders and home improvement retailers like Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) will get a boost. Finally, he points to Costco (COST) as a ""consistent compound grower"" that has a solid grip on the middle and high-end consumer groups.

Shares of the company are moving higher on Monday morning. Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) are moving higher after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $194 per share. The analyst behind the call says the brand has ""successfully expanded its customer reach,"" as one of the reasons for the upgrade.

Catalysts welcomes on Evercore ISI managing director and head of internet research Mark Mahaney to talk about upcoming Big Tech earnings, particularly Alphabet's. ""On the consumer side, whether the Google search results are perceived to be better, more relevant than they were in the past, and we've done our own survey work on this... and so far, we have found that consumers find the results from Gemini and AI overviews to be better than what they had before. And they're responding by doing more searches,"" Mahaney states. ""On the advertiser side... our checks have kind of indicated that the quality of the leads coming out of Google search is slightly improved. If that's true, and if that's sustained, that's what advertisers care about,"" he adds. ""And so if you can maintain that or even improve that, you've got a chance for kind of a double-barreled boost to Google search revenue, both in terms of query volumes and in terms of improved return on ad spend for which advertisers were willing to spend more."" Mahaney also names Uber (UBER) as his number two pick in tech, finding robotaxis will be ""part of the rode-sharing solution."" He also discusses his position on Shopify (SHOP) and Amazon (AMZN).

The cyberattack on CDK Global, the software provider for car dealerships across the US and Canada, led to system outages for auto dealers across North America. Meanwhile, prices for new cars remain well above pre-pandemic levels. CoPilot founder and CEO Pat Ryan explains that the hack ""really threw the industry back to the Stone Age in a lot of ways because with the systems locked down, they [car dealerships] couldn't do business the way they are."" He also points to ""structural increases in car prices"" leading to consumer pressures: ""We're still up over 30% from pre-COVID. So there's sticker shock for people who have bought a car since before COVID. And then when you add in that most cars are bought with financing, about 80% of cars. And so when your car is bought with financing, interest rates go up and prices go up. That has a compounding effect that has really made them unaffordable."" The tech sector was dealt a major blow in Wednesday's trading session as chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and ASML Holding (ASML) sank in the day's session. Meanwhile, signs of a so-called ""Trump Trade"" are ringing throughout Wall Street, specifically with interest in M&A activity which could see a pullback if the former president were to take the White House once again.

""We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict,"" Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that ""no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves."" Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, ""in the long term it's going to do well.""

CEO and organizer of the Bitcoin Conference David Bailey explains: ""Donald Trump is a businessman first and foremost, and he sees a good opportunity. And bitcoin is the greatest opportunity for this country."" He calls the Biden administration's sentiment toward bitcoin (BTC-USD) ""horrendous,"" and as the industry aligns with Trump, they are going to ""send a message to the Democratic Party that that they're on the wrong side of this issue. And that it would be much more productive for them to work with our industry rather than to banish our industry.""

Here's why.,"As advertisers begin to focus on digital spaces, what does this mean for media companies and how will they make that adjustment? What does it mean for the overall media landscape? University of Michigan Ross School of Business marketing professor Marcus Collins joins Wealth! alongside Yahoo Finance senior reporter Alexandra Canal to discuss how streamers are doubling down on advertising. Collins says that customers are turning to streaming due to its lower cost and content selection. They also aren't as locked into a subscription, so it allows customers to switch between services when they want. Collins adds, ""I think that marketers and brands underwrite everything, right?... The irony of all this is that the streaming model is essentially getting closer to a cable model, just augmented with the agency of allowing subscribers to put up more money to circumvent the ads, or to say, 'I'm going to take the ads so that I don't have to pay.' Essentially, what this is getting to is the closer and closer we get to providing consumers more agency, more flexibility, and more freedom, the business models that are built for that will be the ones that essentially will win out in the end.""

He explains, ""the impact is so broad right now in the implementation of more AI and generative AI, including in the PC category... AI PCs have been for sale. They'll probably be part of a cycle as well. It may not be as pronounced as the iPhone cycle, but considering PC sales have been in a hangover the last couple of years, they've started showing signs of growth."" He believes that the outperformance of tech stocks boils down to the fact that tech companies have ""grown earnings when others have not."" He also attributes the growth to diversification, explaining, ""they present less risk because their businesses are so entrenched and diversified."" He highlights Amazon (AMZN) as an example, and expects it to be well-positioned ahead of its earnings. He argues, ""AWS is the biggest hyperscaler, and it's done a lot to catch up to Azure in terms of AI capabilities. And yet Amazon is getting very little credit in terms of multiple. It's trading at at average multiple compared to its historical rates. And so we think that's where when they get more credit that stock will outperform.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI)close at a record high in Monday's session, closing 0.53% higher. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ended the day in the green, slightly below their record closes. The S&P 500 hit an all-time high intraday. Former President Donald Trump has announced Senator JD Vance (R-Oh.) as his vice presidential pick just days after surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Unlimited co-founder, CEO, and CIO Bob Elliott notes that following the assassination attempt, the odds of Trump winning the election have increased. He explains, ""What we're seeing is actually gold (GC=F) as one of the best-performing assets in the market, reflective of the fact that we're likely to get large deficits ahead as the Republicans have a higher probability of controlling all three chambers of the US government. We're seeing bonds sell off as a function of growth likely being stronger and having those larger deficits and higher inflation."" Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is in talks to acquire cyber security startup Wiz for $23 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill is excited by the deal, stating: ""I think this makes a lot more sense given that they [Wiz] can address both small, mid, and large enterprises with this technology. That the government — there's zero chance, in my opinion, they could push back on this because it's enabling the security and safety of data, and no one has dominant market share, so it makes a lot of sense for us... I'd be a lot more excited as a shareholder if this was happening.""

Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into the movements in big tech, the cloud space, and why he believes this merger will be a successful one for Alphabet. Thill is excited by this deal, stating: ""I think this makes a lot more sense given that they [Wiz] can address both small, mid, and large enterprises with this technology. That the government--there's zero chance, in my opinion, they could push back on this because it's enabling the security and safety of data, and no one has dominant market share, so it makes a lot of sense for us. So, again, we've heard a lot of chatter, and M&A by Google. None of it's happened, clearly, the HubSpot deal, at least in the interim, fell apart. But this deal, in my opinion, makes a lot more sense. I'd be a lot more excited as a shareholder if this was happening.

Yahoo Finance got an exclusive first look at AWS’s latest chip, called the Graviton4. What makes this latest chip special? It’s the most powerful and efficient AWS chip to date. It’s 35% faster than the prior generation and has 75% more memory bandwidth. It’s the latest example of the research and development tech firms are willing to pour into chip development. AI is fueling demand for semiconductors - the guts that power the AI boom - meaning companies have to build those guts at a record-breaking pace. Whoever does it the fastest stands to grab up chip juggernaut Nvidia's market share - currently 80% of the GPU chips market. That’s fueling a race between tech and chips companies, not only fueled by competition but also propelled by government incentives designed to fight back against China and have the United States retake the lead as the world’s dominant global chip manufacturer. Can AWS get a larger slice of the chips market pie? Here’s what’s next in the chips race. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT in the business of neurotechnology.

As inflation has put consumers under pressure, Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva provides insight into Americans' dining preferences. A recent Lightspeed survey found that 51% of respondents plan to dine out at the same rate or more frequently in the next six months. He argues that Americans love dining out, pointing to the 81% who dine out at least once a month and 39% who eat out at least once a week. Meanwhile, the results of the Federal Reserve's latest bank stress test results show all 31 of the nation's largest banks could continue to lend in the event of a severe recession. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger breaks down the results and what it means for investors. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer joins the show to break down his biggest takeaways from the trading day, from Amazon's (AMZN) $2 trillion market capitalization to the upcoming weekly jobless claims data. As part of Yahoo Finance's Space Race: Investing in the Final Frontier series, Varda Space Industries Co-Founders Will Bruey and Delian Asparouhouv sit down with Akiko Fujita to give insight into the advantages of pharmaceutical research in microgravity. Bruey outlines how microgravity works and how the company is utilizing it here on Earth, explaining, ""It's ubiquitous and it's impossible to create in perpetuity on Earth. And so we essentially are building space manufacturing modules because we can change the outcome of chemical systems like no one else can on Earth."" Finally, S&P 500 (^GSPC) performance and breadth have hit one of the biggest dislocations in 30 years. Fundstrat Global Advisors managing director Mark Newton tells Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman, ""It doesn't have to mean that the market is going to go into a correction or roll over. Those tech stocks can continue to go up and that divergence can get wider and wider, similar to what we saw back in 2021. However, we can also see what I think is going to happen is as a start of the broader market to play catch up. And we've seen a little bit of that in financials over the last week.""

The data is set to be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET, and he notes that the last month of data has been higher.

Piper Sandler Senior Research Analyst Tom Champion joins Catalysts to give insight to his call and why he is bullish on Uber. Champion claims that his excitement for Uber comes from its potential to grow in using advertising to target users like Amazon (AMZN) has done previously: ""I think the way to frame this is we've seen, over the last 6 or 8 years, Amazon build this gigantic advertising juggernaut. And a lot of this is done through sponsored listings. The ability of Amazon merchants to advertise and promote their goods. And we believe that in all transaction platforms, there exists this promotional advertising opportunity in the gig economy space... with Uber's scale, which really kind of dwarfs the rest of the space, the future looks very interesting.""

Home prices in the 20 largest US cities have surged by an average of 7.2% year over year, according to recent Case-Shiller data. Structured Finance Association CEO Michael Bright advises homebuyers to ""shop around"" and build relationships with brokers to potentially ""get a loan at a lower rate than you otherwise would."" Yahoo Finance's Personal Finance Editor Molly Moorhead also emphasizes the impact of making just one extra mortgage payment each year in saving homeowners money in the long run. US Consumer confidence declined in June, with the index falling to 100.4, signaling growing economic concerns among American consumers. As cost-conscious consumers increasingly seek deals, McDonald's (MCD) has joined the ranks of fast food chains adapting to economic pressures by introducing a new value meal option. Starting June 25, the global fast food giant will add a $5 value meal to its menu. Citi Senior Global Economist Robert Sockin explains that despite these value meals, ""the bigger problem is that you've had large gains in food prices over this cycle. And really, it's taking time for people to adjust to these much higher prices. And as I've noted, as we've got income gains that real purchasing power has improved and is likely to continue to improve given that food inflation is still running at relatively low levels. "" 59% of employees who are not saving for retirement believe they are, according to Principal Financial Group. IRAHelp.com Founder and CPA Ed Slott explains why now is a great time to save for retirement: ""Everybody thinks inflation is bad, and I get that because things cost more. But when it comes to taxes, inflation is great because tax brackets expand too. So more money can come out at lower rates. And the other opportunity now is the low rates... We have historic low tax rates now. So the key to anybody saving for retirement is if you have an IRA, a 401(k), remember those accounts are loaded with taxes. The only way you can get to that money is by paying taxes. So if you can get that money out now, because I'm worried about future higher taxes, we have debt limits, the laws may be changing, so anybody stockpiling money in an IRA or 401(k) should be taking action."" Finally, as the summer travel season heats up, Yahoo Finance's Kerry Hannon breaks down how you can still find a deal. She believes the key to summer travel is being flexible: ""If you can travel the last two weeks of August, that's going to be a good time. And it gives you time to book it right now and get some of the best advantages of that time gap in order to nail down some of these good rates."" She notes that skipping popular destinations is also preferable, explaining, ""Hotel prices are up about 10% particularly in the crowded cities. So I encourage people, maybe skip Paris, go to Lyon, skip Dublin, go to Cork.""

Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the 2024 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity to discuss where sports streaming fits into the broader game plan for major streaming service providers. Mayer calls sports and news ""the last bastion of pay TV"" with the future of linear television mainly coming down to sports. ""The outlook for pay television isn't great, and when sports viewers find other opportunities to watch sports, I think you'll see a continuation of that decline and a collapse, frankly, of that environment,"" Mayer says. ""But broadcast is a bit different. That doesn't depend on pay TV to get delivered to households there in every single household. And I do think you'll just see a different type of programming coming on there."" Mayer's resume also includes his tenure as the CEO of TikTok, COO of the popular app's parent company ByteDance, and the chairman of Disney's (DIS) Direct-to-Consumer & International segment.

The Jeff Bezos-founded company has long been seen as ruthless on prices and a relentless innovator, but at the core of those things is the notoriously cutthroat Amazon culture, believed to be a win-at-any-cost mindset.

So what’s next for Amazon and its investors? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Wall Street Journal reporter Dana Mattioli about her explosive new book, ""The Everything War: Amazon’s Ruthless Quest to Own the World and Remake Corporate Power.""

128352546,2024-06-20,14:59:59,2024-06-20 14:59:59,Here's why Reddit has more room to grow: Analyst,"Shares of Reddit (RDDT) are up almost 25% since its IPO debut in March. Needham & Company senior entertainment and internet analyst Laura Martin raised her price target for the company from $63 to $75, citing its new AI deal and more. Martin joins Catalysts to give insight into her call and explain her belief that the social media company has more room to grow. Martin argues Reddit will gain even more from future deals with other tech companies: ""So the margins here are 90% when they do one of these licensing deals and they already have a $200 million deal with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) ... And then they just got another $200 million deal from OpenAI, Sam Altman's company that Microsoft (MSFT) is the big investor in. I expect all the Amazon (AMZN) large language models and the Meta (META) large language models to also license the Reddit conversations to keep up with changing English real quickly.""

128349059,2024-06-20,09:55:09,2024-06-20 09:55:09,How a doctor at Amazon's AWS is using AI to improve healthcare,"As AI and machine learning roll out across virtually every sector of the economy, bringing both cost savings and efficiencies, the biggest tech companies are racing to conquer what they see as the next frontier: healthcare. Dr. Angela Shippy, medical doctor-turned-physician executive at Amazon Web Services, is leading the charge at the world's biggest cloud provider. Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) added $16 billion to their 2024 capex on AI spending this earnings season, a 31% increase from last year. Part of that capital is spent on healthcare, in an effort to target what many see as a broken system that has suffered from long-standing problems that were further exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic. “If we can take away those tiny administrative burdensome tasks and allow them to do what they truly love,” Dr. Shippy said, “then we know we're making it a better experience for them, and we're making it a better experience for the patient as well because they're in control.”Dr. Shippy is leveraging her background as a practicing clinician to inform her work as the Clinical Innovation Lead for healthcare at AWS. In her role, she connects with 700 healthcare providers across the country as they integrate AWS-powered tech solutions into their practices. While 56% of hospitals’ total operating revenue goes toward labor, the field is also challenged with managing labor shortages and increased patient volumes. Dr. Shippy aims to address these issues by deploying devices like Amazon Alexa to empower patients to make requests like turning a light on and off while reducing pressure on staff.

Big tech companies like Meta (META) are backing research into this field, including products that can decode thoughts without requiring surgery. The big question: what does our world look like if big tech companies can read your mind? Tech companies are building off neurotech advancements in the medical world. Meta is backing a team of neuroscientists whose research uncovered nonsurgical ways to detect brain activity and speech to interpret your thoughts. In 2022, Apple (AAPL) also filed a patent for AirPods that uses EEG technology to measure biosignals and electrical activity of a user's brain. Noninvasive mind reading can be revolutionary in medicine for patients - it can also be used by big tech for consumer-facing products that put privacy at risk. Neurorights advocates believe our thoughts are the last piece of data we have left to ourselves. That’s why they are now fighting for legislation that would safeguard our mental privacy while tech companies continue funding brain-scanning research. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT in the business of neurotechnology.

As these companies realize potential in their data sets and money to be made from digital advertising, they continue to vie for any competitive edge they can find. TikTok is an incredibly powerful platform that sees huge volumes of user traffic which in turn can drive consumer growth for companies, both large brands and small businesses. With the US leveraging a potential ban against TikTok if its parent company ByteDance doesn't divest from it, how can these tech giants stir up even tighter competition if a ban ends up going through? MikMak CEO Rachel Tipograph joins Catalysts to discuss her company's findings from ad revenue data and the power TikTok holds in the business world. Tipograph explains: ""TikTok is typically now around our second most trafficked social platform. It goes Meta, then TikTok, then an environment like YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and then X is irrelevant. I share this because I'm not seeing brands pull back from TikTok. I think right now they're actually trying to put their pedal on the gas while TikTok's around. TikTok is an amazing channel to drive consumer growth. We're seeing it in beauty, we're starting to see it in grocery."" She then affirms: ""If TikTok was to go away, Meta would win, YouTube would win, CTV would win. TikTok is really a play of brand awareness and video, and so those dollars would just get reallocated.""

Big Tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have all announced major investments in building out their AI infrastructures. While the plans show confidence in the future, will they actually pay off? Bokeh Capital Partners Founder and Chief Investment Officer Kimberly Forrest joins Morning Brief to give insight into the AI sector and discuss which companies are in the best position to actually benefit from AI investments. When asked about when investors will see real payoffs from these big investments from AI, Forrest says: ""Building out the data center is part of it, then you're going to have companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), and everybody else is going to pile in and start using the generative AI to maybe increase productivity... And I would look for who do you think is most likely to benefit from using generative AI. And we've just mentioned them, right? Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, and to me Microsoft is really probably [in] the best position because they'll get people to actually pay for it, not just advertising dollars.""

The company announced that it expects same-day pharmacy delivery services to become available in up to a dozen US cities by the end of the year. Amazon Pharmacy Chief Medical Officer Dr. Vin Gupta joins Wealth! to discuss the move and what the current state of pharmacies lacks for the average consumer. ""If your provider can get that prescription in before, say, 5:00, we're able to get that to your door before the end of the evening,"" Gupta explains. He highlights the importance of this service for consumers with acute conditions, saying, ""that time to treatment is critical."" The service will not have additional charges for same-day deliveries, ""and that's exactly what people expect from Amazon,"" Gupta says. ""We know that 30% of people don't pick up their refills on time, or if ever, because it's an inconvenient experience, especially if you're not feeling well,"" adding that he believes Amazon's new initiative will make major strides in the average consumer's health. The service will have a different sign-on and portal experience, keeping health data separate and private from users' retail profiles. Gupta explains that it will also offer several different ways to pay with or without insurance, touting a discount savings program and automatically applied manufacturer coupons. He adds that in addition to the home delivery service, a team of clinical pharmacists will be available 24/7 to answer any patient questions. ""We're truly building the modern pharmacy that the future needs,"" he tells Brad Smith and Anjalee Khemlani.

The company has also utilized AI to improve personalized recommendations for its users. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita are joined by Pinterest CEO Bill Ready at the Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss the impact of new deals from tech giants.

Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination to discuss Amazon's upcoming earnings and why investors should pay attention to how Amazon Web Services performs. On what to expect with AWS, Bajarin states: ""Everybody is going to be looking at cloud growth for AWS. Right now, it's super trendy to talk about CapEx, everyone wants to see what the hyperscalers are spending in terms of new infrastructure, buying AI servers, creating 'AI factories,' as Nvidia (NVDA) likes to call them. I think that's what's going to be a big spotlight, what Amazon's growth is doing in terms of AWS. I think it's probably predictable it will be healthy, somewhat double-digit. Where are they going, where are they guiding, and what CapEx are they investing?"" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Niles Investment Management Founder Dan Niles joins Catalysts to explore how tech giants benefit from each other's earnings reports, as well as the market's reaction to tech earnings. ""Meta came out first, and they guided below the Street for next quarter's revenues, but then they took up their cap-x as well as their expenses. Google came out after that, and remember, Meta went down 11%, and Google initiated a dividend, which was great, but if you look at the forward numbers, actually, the estimates across the Street actually edged down for revenues for their upcoming June quarter as well. So, I think to some extent, Google benefitted from Meta going first, and if you look at Microsoft, sort of a similar situation, where the stock was up, I think, 2% or so the next day, but again, they came after Meta, and Microsoft's forward revenue numbers edged down slightly as well,"" Niles explained.

Peters suggests that the Fed meeting on Wednesday may not be ""all that interesting,"" as Chairman Jerome Powell may need to ""walk back being more dovish"" in light of the hot inflation data failing to align with the Fed's target. This scenario could compel the central bank to hold rates steady and refrain from implementing rate cuts. While Peters acknowledges the potential for a rate hike, he notes that ""it's not the base case."" The ""root cause"" of the Fed's rate-cut apprehension is ""a positive story,"" Peters says. He points to the robust state of the economy, coupled with slightly higher inflation, as a backdrop that is ""favorable for broad earnings.""

In 2023 alone, the company brought in more than $648 billion dollars in revenue. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into the company’s biggest moments. 1962 Walmart was founded by Sam Walton. Its first location was in Rogers, Arkansas. 1967 The Walton family owned 24 stores and had racked up $12.7 million in sales. 1970 On October 1, 1970, Walmart went public via an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares opened at $16.50 per share. 1983 The company opened its first Sam's Club in Oklahoma in a bid to compete with Costco’s (COST) wholesale, member-only model. 1988 Founder Sam Walton stepped down as CEO, and David Glass was named his successor. That same year, the first Walmart Supercenter opened in Washington, Missouri, creating what it’s currently known for – a mix of general merchandise and grocery. 1996 Walmart opened its first location in China and surpassed $1 billion in sales for the year. 2000 Walmart.com launched, allowing US customers to shop online – as Amazon.com (AMZN) began to take off. 2017 To compete with Amazon, among other online retailers, Walmart introduced free two-day shipping. 2020-2021 During the pandemic, the retailer boomed as consumers sought out the Covid-19 vaccine, and then, cheaper groceries as inflation picked up. 2024 In late March, Walmart stock reached a record closing high of $61.45 per share. And it only keeps growing – with more than 10,500 stores in 19 different countries. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Pelosky offers his views on China's tech sector: ""We're more keen on tech outside the United States, and in particular, in China. And so, we have identified what we call a two-tech stack divide between the US and China, where both countries are basically sealing off their tech sectors from each other, and we think that creates a real opportunity within China tech, which has been a huge laggard versus the US. Its e-commerce market is twice the size of the US, growing at 10% per annum, and the stocks, like Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (0700.HK), etc, are trading at a 50 to 60% discount to the United States tech stocks.""

With inflation making its way through consumer goods and services, how are consumers feeling about these price increases? Will they continue to opt in to select services or should streaming companies like Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) be worried? D’Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University Associate Dean of Research and Professor of Marketing Koen Pauwels joins Wealth! to give insight into how consumers are reacting to rising subscription costs from streaming providers.  ""If you're the kind of consumer who is relatively price insensitive and you don't want to be bothered with ads and you want all of your shows to be on one kind of data provider so you don't have to lose the time to figure out which show is where, then you're going to settle [and] select for this ad-free tier,"" Pauwels points out, ""which also means that Netflix (NFLX) can continue raising prices on that one because their pool of consumers choosing for this non-ad service is going to be more restricted, more selective who don't care about prices that much.""

Quickplay Co-Founder and Chief Business Officer Paul Pastor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the implications of this partnership for the evolving streaming landscape. Pastor emphasizes that it is an ""unbelievable time"" to be a part of the media industry, given the tremendous amount of change underway. Drawing on his experience dating back to when cable was emerging, Pastor notes that streaming is now ""the topic du jour."" Regarding the MrBeast deal, Pastor explains that projects with ""stars attached"" to them in Hollywood tend to reduce risk and boost engagement, stressing that the Amazon-MrBeast collaboration is a ""tried and true"" model. However, he highlights that this deal also opens the door for other content creators on YouTube to ""build out incredible franchises"" beyond just the YouTube platform itself— which will benefit both the influencer class and the production companies involved.

He says Claude 3l is available to AWS customers, who can build on top of the model to build their needed AI functions.  Wood tells Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley he has never seen such excitement from customers over a new technology.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is closing the quarter at a new record high, marking the best first quarter since 2019. While 2023 saw the Magnificent Seven tech stocks fuel market gains initially, the first quarter of 2024 is ending with only four of those names — Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) — carrying the momentum. Apple (AAPL) continues to struggle, declining for three straight months.

The goal? To preserve a good shopping experience while also fighting theft, a problem that’s impacting margins and causing safety concerns. The scope of the theft problem is hard to measure, though mentions of organized retail crime rose by 43% on earnings calls in the first half of 2023. To find clarity on this issue, Yahoo Finance explores a first of its kind, AI-driven heat map that could empower retailers to share real-time crime data with each other, and gets an exclusive look at the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the rise in organized retail crime, which they say is about much more than petty shoplifting. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.For more on our NEXT series, click here, and tune tune in to Yahoo Finance Live for more expert insight and the latest market action, Monday through Friday.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=64c0174ab3e8028c11e30cd0ac24509b7b56d9cabe299809501ec05153e3d10e,"[('positive', 0.5782613), ('neutral', 0.40483904), ('negative', 0.016899617)]",0.5782613,0.40483904,0.016899617,0.5613617

The 29-year-old co-founded Asian food startup Omsom with her sister, Kim. The company sells chef-crafted packaged noodles and sauces. So far, Omsom has managed to sell more than 4 million products and is available in more than 2,000 stores, including Whole Foods (AMZN), Target (TGT), and Sprouts (SFM). Pham and her sister, the daughters of Vietnamese refugees, were able to secure investors such as Away Co-founder and CEO Jen Rubio, Zola Co-founder and CEO Shan-Lyn Ma, and food-focused VC firm New Fare Partners Founder Elly Truesdell. At Omsom’s office in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Pham gives Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma a literal taste of how she leads her small team to shake up ethnic aisles and change the way consumers eat and think about Asian cuisine. “Omsom is all about being proud and loud, especially when the stereotype of Asian Americans in America's kind of like submissive, or docile,” Pham says. “Omsom is our true kind of energy and ethos and spirit.” Pham details not only how she and her sister have managed to build the brand at such a young age, but also how they were able to launch during the pandemic and endure the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held the business’s capital.

Nike's (NKE) slogan and 'Swoosh' logo that defines the iconic brand is now a staple for footwear, athletic apparel, and pop culture. The company generated more than $51 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of about $4.5 billion year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at Nike's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker, which charts its path to becoming a global icon. 1964 Nike was originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman on January 25, 1964. 1971 The company was renamed Nike and began using the 'Swoosh' logo, created by Portland State University student Carolyn Davis, who sold Nike the logo for just $35. 1980 On December 2, 1980, Nike went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ at $22 per share. 1984 The company signed Michael Jordan, launching the Air Jordan series. Within the first two months of the shoe’s release, Nike sold $70 million worth of Air Jordans. 1997 Nike spun the Jordan brand into its own division featuring the 'Jumpman' logo. 2004 Nike acquired rival Converse for $309 million. Later that year, Phil Knight stepped down as CEO and president of Nike, but continued his chairman role. 2012 Nike became the official supplier for NFL apparel. 2013 Nike became a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing Alcoa (AA). 2015 The company was named the official supplier for NBA apparel. 2016 Phil Knight officially stepped down from all duties with the company on June 30, 2016. 2019 In November 2019, Nike stopped selling directly through Amazon (AMZN), focusing more on direct relationships with customers. 2021 On November 5, 2021, Nike stock hit an all-time high, trading at $173.12 per share. With the stock down nearly 20% over the past year, as concerns over slowing sales growth and demand in China mount, investors are waiting for the next leg of innovation from the shoe company. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term. With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility.""

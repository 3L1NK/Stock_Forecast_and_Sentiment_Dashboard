CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino joins Catalysts to share his outlook on the tech market. Zino notes that while tech has ""led the way"" in the market recovery, it remains ""the worst performing sector"" since July's market peak. Semiconductors experienced the most severe sell-off but have since shown the strongest gains and recovery. Looking ahead, Zino predicts ""more choppy action"" following this surge, expecting market volatility to persist for the next 2-3 months and through the election period. He notes that earnings drive tech stocks and highlights two potential catalysts: Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming Blackwell launch and the likely Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16 release. ""Those are the two product launches that we think could potentially see more upside to consensus estimates,"" Zino states. However, he cautions investors not to ""expect anything too extreme here, at least in the immediate near term"" from the tech sector.

Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner joins Wealth! to discuss the state of the tech industry sa recession fears circulate. If July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes in higher than expected and interest rates start to come down, Wagner argues that the Magnificent Seven will ""continue to be that funding mechanism, much like what we saw in the middle of July."" ""You saw that capital flow from the Magnificent Seven to some of the smaller-cap cohorts to more of the real estate investment trust areas, the utilities, and even some of the more consumer cyclical and the consumer discretionary area,"" he says. Wagner notes that the flow of capital will remain with the Magnificent Seven because ""there's so much resiliency, there's so much pricing in elasticity that a lot of those companies have."" While the safe move 10 years ago was to invest in staples like utilities, Wagner believes it is now in AI tech names: ""The amount of profit margin and operating leverage that a lot of these Magnificent Seven companies have, that's where the flow of capital is going to go if investors are looking for safety. And so if you think that there's going to be volatility in the market, not just here in the near term, but over say the next three to four months, I'd be putting my capital in the Mag Seven.""

As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are reversing some of the gains made in Thursday's trading session as volatility rocks the market. Edward Jones senior investment strategist Mona Mahajan explains, ""Markets have certainly calmed much more meaningfully over the last couple of days than we saw Monday and Tuesday of this week even... We've seen this week alone the jobless claim figures that came in below expectations provided a little comfort to the market that is really looking for direction on a couple of things. One, is the US labor market headed towards some sort of meaningful collapse or downside, and two, is the broader economy headed towards a downturn as well? And I think for us, both of the answers to both of those questions are no."" The tech sector has been particularly rocked by market volatility this week, yet Goldman Sachs Asset Management fundamental equity managing director Luke Barrs still sees opportunity. ""Selectively, there's great opportunity across the broad market, but specifically in tech as well. There are some transformational themes that are coming through that are driving earnings,"" he explains. He adds, ""When we come to technology, what is very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture, but also the fact that people want to see... evidence that that gen AI trade is actually driving positive outcomes."" A global market sell-off occurred on Monday after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates, which unwinded the yen carry trade (JPY=X). TD Securities global head of FX and EM strategy Mark McCormick believes that the carry trade unwind isn't over, explaining, ""The structural nature of the carry trade is that for pretty much around the last decade, Japanese investors have put their money, mostly pension funds, which accounts for about 80% of GDP in other markets. So the assets that they're tracking in other markets are actually a big form of the carry trade."" Some retail investors used the market sell-off as a buying opportunity. IG Group North America CEO JJ Kinahan notes, ""Every crisis... we've had over the last five years, where retail traders tend to start are two technology names, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT)."" He adds that ""Apple and Microsoft are going to be names that retail trades significantly anyways, but made up a larger percentage of trading on Monday and Tuesday, for sure, as people were looking for places to go buy.""

The major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are bouncing back after a three-day sell-off triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July. As investors continue to be wary of a recession, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok notes that despite the weak labor report, there's not much other evidence that points to a recession: ""Daily data for how many people fly on airplanes as of last Friday is still strong. Daily data from OpenTable for how many people go to restaurants is still strong. Weekly data for retail sales from Redbook is also still strong. Hotel occupancy rates, the weekly data also still strong."" He reiterates Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emphasis on the totality of the data, and adds, ""the market is overreacting to just one data point."" Note: Apollo Global Management is Yahoo's parent company. Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist Chris Watling explains, ""Sell-offs tend to happen in waves. So it's not just a straight line down, then we're done. You know, they tend to be three waves or five waves. And in the middle of that, you get these relief rallies. So it's perfectly natural that you have a very aggressive downside, a little bit of short covering, which creates a rally, which is probably what we're in now."" For investors trying to navigate the pullback, he encourages them to ""buy the bounce, trade them for a couple of weeks, go long if you're nimble, but really lighten up if you're if you're sort of multi-month investor. It all depends on your time frames. That's the challenge."" A federal judge found Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google search and advertising business to be in violation of antitrust laws. Presiding over the case levied by the Department of Justice, US District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote ""Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly."" Many experts are speculating whether this ruling over Google's search dominance could impact another tech giant: Apple (AAPL). Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley explains why this antitrust case could hurt the iPhone maker who has a revenue-sharing agreement with Google to make its search engine the default on its smartphones. Meanwhile, new earnings reports hit the market on Tuesday. Shares of Saudi Aramco (2223.SR) are trading higher after the company met second quarter net income expectations and will pay a quarterly dividend totaling $31.1 billion. Shares of Yum! Brands (YUM) are also climbing despite reporting mixed second quarter results. While the KFC and Taco Bell parent missed revenue expectations and saw same-store sales drop in those chains, its earnings topped analyst forecasts. Yum! Brands attributed the weakness to a softening consumer spending environment and Middle East tensions.

Forte points out: ""I think the ultimate story for Apple is that there will be an upgrade cycle for iPhones, which is still the most important product, half their revenue. The question is how quickly will that start? Because there were headlines recently suggesting that they're going to have new hardware for consumers, assumingly in September, but they may have to wait for a software update to get Apple Intelligence to work."" Forte has a Hold rating on the stock: ""Because you're looking at a PE north of 30 times versus the big tech peers, more like 27.5. And when you compare the iPhone trends before the 5G, there was actually a lot more pent up demand for new iPhones leveraging 5G networks then I believe there's pent up demand for artificial intelligence."" However, he points out a challenge for Apple: ""When you look at Europe, which is about 25% of revenue and China, which is about 19% of revenue, it doesn't appear that they're going to be able to launch Apple Intelligence any time soon.""

Winthrop Capital Management portfolio manager Luke Stone joins Catalysts to discuss these market dynamics. Stone observes a ""rotation narrative"" in the markets, where the Magnificent Seven stocks' valuations are considered too lofty, making it ""very hard to hit"" expectations. As this trend continues, he suggests investors may reduce their positions in these stocks and look elsewhere in the broader market for attractive opportunities. ""Investors are growing a little bit impatient that we're kicking the can down the road,"" Stone notes, referring to Big Tech names as investors wait for AI investments to yield returns. He cautions, ""all of this CapEx [capital expenditures] is great today, but if you don't have a customer base to execute on in a year from now, or if that customer base declines from worsening economic scenarios, you're going to run into issues down the road.""

""We're at this point where people are still a little uncertain what it means. You have all these knowledge workers where work is being done for them.

He acknowledges that there were significant concerns surrounding Apple, including a slowdown in China and the lack of a clear AI strategy. However, he points out that share loss in China has stabilized, and the company's AI strategy is now more evident with Apple Intelligence. ""I think you're kind of having a setup where things have turned positive for Apple from a sentiment standpoint,"" he told Yahoo Finance. Despite this optimism, Sankar cautions that Apple's AI initiatives will not drive ""a massive AI refresh driven by the phone this year."" He suggests that such developments are more likely to materialize in 2025. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Investors will be watching the results closely following some mixed results from Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL). Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Bryant VanCronkhite joins Wealth! to give insight into the upcoming tech earnings from Big Tech names and what investors should keep in mind moving forward. VanCronkhite explains that though the AI trade has fueled the market gains, right now, the developments aren't really showing up in quarterly results, leaving some investors questioning when it will happen. In terms of the tech sector, and the rotation into small caps that has been seen in markets the last few weeks, VanCronkhite states: ""I've been calling for this value rotation going back a couple of weeks now, and it's starting to play out well. There could be more legs to this, and it makes a lot of sense. With the amount of money being concentrated in a narrow market, we only get there for one of two reasons. We either get there because of greed or exuberance, which we have today around the AI trade, or you get there out of fear. When you're worried about the overall economy, maybe the Fed being late to react, pushing us into a recession, you want to get more and more capital around a fewer and fewer set of companies where you have the most visibility."" He continues with: ""So both fear and greed have pushed capital into a narrow market, but those will both get resolved eventually. And I think that the cool inflation prints is giving the market the belief the Fed can begin to act, giving them the chance to jump through that ever closing window to avoid a recession. And as that happens, the natural rotation is out of the concentrate names into the value trade into the broader markets.""

128881528,2024-07-24,15:10:22,2024-07-24 15:10:22,Mag 7 must perform 'incredibly well' to justify valuations,"The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is facing downward pressure Wednesday morning following earnings data out from two Magnificent Seven members: EV maker Tesla (TSLA) and Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG). The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 — commonly referred to as the 493 — being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

And when I look at the next step, the use cases, Palantir, I think, is going to really be the one that's front and center in a lot of these deals,"" Ives argues, calling the company the ""Messi of AI."" He points to IP (intellectual property) conversion as a major growth area alongside its commercial and government businesses. He adds, ""I don't know how you could have a basket of AI stocks and just dismiss Palantir."" Broadening the conversation, Ives expects a ""massive tech earnings season"" for semiconductors: ""There's no denying this AI revolution is probably the biggest tech trend we've seen in the last 40, 50 years."" Apple (AAPL) is the latest player to enter the AI game, announcing its plans to integrate OpenAI's large-language model into its platforms.

Nintendo exec talks game industry 'poised for an upswing',"The video game industry is reaching outside of its comfort zone as audiences are seeing exposure to more video game adaptations, TV series, M&A activity between studios, and even partnerships with popular streaming services. ""The overall entertainment industry is large, it's a significant part of the global economy. And gaming is the biggest part of that — it's a $200 billion business today. It's bigger than streaming, bigger than the movie box office. Across the globe, 3 billion people play video games,"" former Nintendo (NTDOY) of America President and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé explains to Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend. An industry veteran, Fils-Aimé held the positions of Nintendo of America president and COO from 2006 to 2019. He believes the gaming industry is ""poised for an upswing"" following post-pandemic contractions from game studios and consumers. Fils-Aimé weighs in on rising trends in gaming, including VR and AR headsets (virtual reality and augmented reality) — namely Apple's (AAPL) costly Vision Pro — and cloud gaming technology. Cloud gaming is ""just going to be another way that consumers can get access to games in the end, this is an industry that is driven by content,"" Fils-Aimé says, underlining the fact that it will ""always come down to the games"" no matter the platform or hardware behind it.

""We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict,"" Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that ""no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves."" Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, ""in the long term it's going to do well."" In order to navigate this dynamic, he encourages investors to limit their exposure ""and be exposed to it in a very diversified way.""

Seana Smith and Brad Smith help investors through the market open and discuss what's moving markets, like June's retail sales data. In this installment of The Morning Brief, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) reported second quarter earnings. Argus Research director of financial services research Stephen Biggar joins the show to discuss the latest Big Bank earnings and what lower interest rates would hold in store for the banking sector. As Apple (AAPL) hopes to inspire a new upgrade cycle in its newest iPhone's AI features — dubbed Apple Intelligence — the tech giant also has its eyes set on the consumer market in India. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria describes the country's consumer prospects as a ""long-term promise"" for Apple.

Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss some of the biggest trends dominating the tech sector as second quarter earnings season kicks off. Luria points to Microsoft's (MSFT) AI efforts driving a PC upgrade cycle. He explains, ""the impact is so broad right now in the implementation of more AI and generative AI, including in the PC category... AI PCs have been for sale. They'll probably be part of a cycle as well. It may not be as pronounced as the iPhone cycle, but considering PC sales have been in a hangover the last couple of years, they've started showing signs of growth."" He believes that the outperformance of tech stocks boils down to the fact that tech companies have ""grown earnings when others have not."" He also attributes the growth to diversification, explaining, ""they present less risk because their businesses are so entrenched and diversified."" He highlights Amazon (AMZN) as an example, and expects it to be well-positioned ahead of its earnings. He argues, ""AWS is the biggest hyperscaler, and it's done a lot to catch up to Azure in terms of AI capabilities. And yet Amazon is getting very little credit in terms of multiple. It's trading at at average multiple compared to its historical rates. And so we think that's where when they get more credit that stock will outperform.""

D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss the tech giant's growth and what it means for its upcoming iPhone release cycle. AI integration will be a key component in the newest iPhones as Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI at its Worldwide Developers Conference. ""We haven't had a major iPhone upgrade cycle since iPhone 12. And now that there is a sense that there's enough new functionality and uses for the phone that we will have an upgrade cycle, which could last for a year or two. That warrants this excitement around the stock,"" Luria says. He believes that new Apple Intelligence features will compel consumers enough to drive a new device upgrade cycle. As Apple looks to diversify its exposure to global consumer markets, Luria believes India ""has a long-term promise,"" explaining: ""It's the country that's creating the most middle-class and upper-middle-class population anywhere around the world by far. It is in that sense the kind of driver that China was for the last 20 or 30 years. And so that's why it's a critically important market."" He adds that there are no domestic competitors to Apple in India — like Huawei in China — allowing the tech giant to dominate the market.

S3 Partners managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky joins Catalysts to discuss some of the biggest tech names eyed by short sellers. When it comes to Nvidia, Dusaniwsky explains that investors are shorting ""because it's an overheated stock."" While the run-up has been monumental, he notes that ""it's got to come back to Earth."" He also explains that some investors are shorting the stock ""because it's a hedge to the market. People are shorting Nvidia to hedge their entire portfolio and hedge their tech holdings. So you've got two different types of short selling going on in this name."" Dusaniwsky also points to Apple (AAPL) as a heavily shorted name, explaining that it's not fundamental investing: ""We're looking at a lot of traders that are looking at momentum and technical graphs and saying, 'Hey, I want to short this name. I want to go long this name'... More traders are going and looking at recent activity in the short side and kind of running along with that crowd or getting ahead of the crowd getting out of a name.""

As Americans kick off their holiday weekend, AAA Travel senior vice president Paula Twidale breaks down what Americans can expect from July Fourth travel. Twidale explains that American airports are gearing up for a record 70.9 million people traveling for the holiday, revealing that the pent-up pandemic-era travel demand isn't over: ""Consumers are not willing to give up the respite they deserve,"" she says. The Pacific Northwest, theme parks, and urban cities such as New York and Chicago are particularly popular domestic destinations, Twidale notes. However, she adds that international travel is equally high. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed at record highs in Tuesday's session. Jared Blikre breaks down his three biggest takeaways from the trading day: Tesla shares closing above $200, market concentration topping the 1929 peak, and the dip in stock volatility. Rising home prices and high mortgage rates are shutting out would-be US homebuyers. Angi co-founder Angie Hicks explains that Americans who would have thought about moving are now thinking about renovation. According to Angi's home spending reports, bathrooms are consistently in the top five renovation projects, while kitchens are in the top 10. Outdoor remodeling remains popular even in post-pandemic times, she adds. Seana Smith joins the show to analyze a new Wells Fargo chart showing the potential rebalancing of earnings growth in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Wells Fargo notes that earnings growth will broaden beyond the ""Magnificent 7,"" while participation and profitability outside of tech and communication services will also broaden.

TD Bank Global Head of FX and EM Strategy Mark McCormick joins Catalysts in-studio to discuss the influence the Fed's interest rate journey and the 2024 US presidential election could have on the US dollar.

128556005,2024-07-02,16:05:39,2024-07-02 16:05:39,Big Tech-EU regulation battle is 'new chapter in an old movie',"Meta Platforms (META) is under fire by EU regulators who claim the company's ad subscription model is a pay-for-content scheme that requires users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to use for targeted advertising. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as ""gatekeepers."" Meta was identified by the Commission as a ""gatekeeper"" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, ""I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model."" He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a ""slap on the wrist"" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): ""Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

As Nvidia continues on its downward trajectory after leading the S&P 500's (^GSPC) growth, B. Riley Wealth Chief Market Strategist Art Hogan believes the market can keep up its momentum without the chip giant: ""I think it's a perfect example of a lot of folks being concerned that Nvidia and arguably Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) were such a big part of the 15% that the S&P 500 is higher this year on a year to date basis... But you're seeing basically three or four days where Nvidia has not been leading the charge, and the market's done very well. I think that continues throughout the second half of this year."" The European Union has charged Apple under its Digital Markets Act, alleging that the tech giant's App Store practices prevent app developers from directing consumers to cheaper services. TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell believes the investigation is unlikely to conclude anytime soon, and that Apple will have to make some changes: ""I do think Apple is going to have to make some tweaks, some things that they don't necessarily want to do, but at the end of the day, again, it's an important enough market that they're going to have to follow some of these requirements that the EU is putting into place. And therefore, long term, I don't think the impact is that big of a deal as far as the value of the company and the way people view the stock."" Cryptocurrencies are also under pressure, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) having its worst trading day since March. Meanwhile, the health industry is making major moves, as Altimmune (ALT) reported positive results in Phase 2 trials for its weight-loss drug, a Teladoc Health (TDOC) study showed its AI models contributed to positive growth in diabetes management, and Novo Nordisk revealed plans to invest $4.1 billion in building out a manufacturing facility in Clayton, North Carolina for its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the 2024 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity to discuss where sports streaming fits into the broader game plan for major streaming service providers. Mayer calls sports and news ""the last bastion of pay TV"" with the future of linear television mainly coming down to sports. ""The outlook for pay television isn't great, and when sports viewers find other opportunities to watch sports, I think you'll see a continuation of that decline and a collapse, frankly, of that environment,"" Mayer says. ""But broadcast is a bit different. That doesn't depend on pay TV to get delivered to households there in every single household. And I do think you'll just see a different type of programming coming on there."" Mayer's resume also includes his tenure as the CEO of TikTok, COO of the popular app's parent company ByteDance, and the chairman of Disney's (DIS) Direct-to-Consumer & International segment.

Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) has reclaimed its title as the most valuable US company in market capitalization. Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into the performance of the Big Tech stocks and explain what investors should consider for their portfolios. ""We think that mega-caps drove the first leg of this upturn this year. And as we get into the second half, we think the upturn will broaden to mid-cap stocks. So that's where we are really looking most for opportunities. We still like Nvidia. We still see a lot of upside, but we don't think it's going to be as outsized of a performer compared to the rest of our portfolio,"" Delevska explains. She adds that cybersecurity is a ""particularly exciting"" sector because the fundamentals are improving ""by the day.""

While Apple has struggled with iPhone sales in recent history — especially in China's consumer market — could this new tech help improve sales? Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Catalysts to give insight into why she believes it's too early to tell if this announcement will truly change anything for Apple from a sales perspective. ""I do not think that will play out in the current iPhone [16] that gets launched in September, especially because you saw today the headline was that Apple needs a large language model in China because China doesn't allow any of the large language models that are sitting in America to be used,"" Martin claims.

Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer sits down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi by the Cannes waterfront to talk about where linear TV and sports streaming fits into the broadening streaming landscape, as more platforms like Amazon Prime (AMZN) adopt ad-supported subscription tiers. ""One of the reasons paid TV is in such [a] secular and substantial decline is the cost of those sports rights. And everyone had to bear the cost of those sports rights. So you had every consumer, almost every household had paid TV 10 years ago, and everyone was paying not only for the entertainment that they loved, but also for sports,"" Mayer explains. ""And not everyone watched the sports. And I think that helped drive the decline down. People were paying for something in a very expensive thing that they didn't really want to watch.  ""So I think Netflix (NFLX) will put their toe in the water, but they've become a very successful entertainment company without sports. They have sports-related programming, but not the actual sports rights."" Mayer finds that these major streaming companies need to incorporate these new sports partnerships in order to ""feed their ecosystem in some way."" Mayer's resume also includes his tenure as the CEO of TikTok, COO of the popular app's parent company ByteDance, and the chairman of Disney's Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. Mayer comments on the potential ban of TikTok within the United States and the acquisition sage surrounding Paramount Global (PARA, PARAA).

Canaccord Genuity Managing Director George Gianarikas joins the discussion, providing insights into the implications of this historic compensation plan for the company's future. Bireme Capital Founder and Chief Investment Officer Evan Tindell offers his perspective on the potential concerns surrounding short-sellers and their impact on Tesla's stock performance.

Here's why.,"Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL) have had eventful weeks: the EV company passed a shareholder vote in favor of CEO Elon Musk's pay package, and the tech giant announced new AI initiatives at its Worldwide Developers Conference. Despite the positive news, Bireme Capital founder and chief investment officer Evan Tindell is short-selling both stocks and joins Catalysts to share his reasoning. ""It's been a very difficult period for shorting any stocks... but for us it kind of rhymes with the 2021 period where, of course you had the SPAC craze,"" Tindell explains. He continues, ""the growing valuations, or overvaluations in our view, of some of these stocks in 2021 contributed to huge underperformance of the Nasdaq and other sort of growth names in 2022, which allowed us to outperform by around 50%."" When it comes to Apple, Tindell is skeptical that its AI replacement cycle can drive $300 billion of value. He notes that if AI drives more searches to Siri over Safari, it could end up endangering Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

State Street Global Advisors Chief Investment Strategist Michael Arone joins Morning Brief to break down what's driving the market (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) amid sticky inflation. Arone points to tech earnings as a major market catalyst while the economy cools. He believes that the momentum fueled by the AI boom can continue, calling semiconductors ""the key ingredient to the global economy."" Arone explains that if the economy gets the soft landing envisioned by the Fed, the market will broaden out with greater participation in tech. While the AI race shows no signs of slowing anytime soon, Arone warns, ""I think that we really need to move from possibilities of AI to the practical implications of AI."" He believes Apple (AAPL) will be key to that equation, as it is relatively late to the AI game, yet looking to adopt the technology and get it on the market as soon as possible.

Pernas Research Co-Founder Deiya Pernas and Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney join Market Domination to discuss the state of index investing. Pernas believes investors' biggest worry should be ""complacency"" in the indexes. ""The market's trading at 21 times forward. and it's somewhat typical of late-cycle that you see large cap quality do quite well and that's what we've seen this year,"" Pernas elaborates, pointing out small cap equities' value growth is flat and may not be participating in market rallies. ""If you look at it holistically, there's some areas of the market where cracks are evident, but again, at the index level, I think there's a lot of complacency."" ""Tere's a lot of examples this earnings season, especially in technology, so we don't need to be near airlines and autos or retailers or some of these other ones that are mentioned. We don't need to be in those industries,"" Mahoney explains, later going on to discuss big names in tech. ""We're in the fast lane, we're growth managers.

Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Asking for a Trend to break down the earnings and analyze how long the company can keep up the momentum. Despite beating Wall Street's expectations, Basenese highlights that the magnitude of Nvidia's beat is the smallest it has ever been, at about 8%. He warns, ""Expectations at some point are going to get too far ahead of what Nvidia can deliver, but it's not yet."" ""I think it's the leading candidate to be the next $3 trillion market cap company, but if I had a dollar to put to work today and I want to 10x it, it's not Nvidia. It's probably in the smaller cap side of the market,"" he adds, saying that of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is the most ""reasonably valued."" Basenese calls Nvidia's stock split a ""brilliant move psychologically,"" as buying a stock at a lower price is more enticing. He adds that it does not change any of Nvidia's fundamental metrics or value calculations. For investors looking to get in on the AI sector, Basenese highlights Microsoft's (MSFT) ability to push AI products onto the market to create demand. He also points to Apple (AAPL) as ""the sleeper AI play.""  ""Apple is kind of perceived as they missed the boat ... they're never first or second to market. They come in later, but then they go. They come in late, but they end up being the leader."" He adds, ""They have two billion active devices in use. If they just iterate and add a little AI somewhere, it has a magnified impact.""

The verbal sparring between Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers and the head of Apple's app store kicked off a hearing focused on whether Apple is still steering U.S. consumers to its once-exclusive app payment system in defiance of an injunction aimed at promoting more choices that could help lower prices.  Gonzalez Rogers' order requires Apple to allow app developers to display links to other options besides the company's own payment system in the U.S. Apple makes billions of dollars annually from that setup, which imposes commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within the most popular iPhone apps.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=463cb43b4bf2508bebfe7f7455a7536d9b137de6a2222299e95a8e8d4aaa61e5,"[('neutral', 0.7065633), ('negative', 0.26125664), ('positive', 0.03217999)]",0.03217999,0.7065633,0.26125664,-0.22907665

Yahoo Finance Anchors Brian Sozzi and Akiko Fujita are joined by Nuveen CEO Saira Malik at the Annual Milken Global Institute Conference to discuss whether there has been an overallocation in Big Tech names, leading to possible underperformance. ""I think it's the year of being selective, and you saw that last week with Meta (META), which actually put up a good quarter with 27% revenue growth. But the whisper numbers were for 30% revenue growth. Stock goes down because it's over over-owned. Now you look at Apple (AAPL), where if you look at the fundamentals of the quarter, it's more about the next iPhone cycle seasonality, trade. But the stock was under-owned. So Apple goes up. So I think that crowding in these tech stocks is important for these stocks,"" Malik tells Yahoo Finance.

I think that's an appropriate rebalancing, given how well the stock had done for the company. I mean, it hasn't done that great this year, but historically for Berkshire, it's done well.""

However, not all investors are bullish on the stock, even after the tech giant announced a staggering $110 billion share buyback program. Joining Catalysts is Bireme Capital Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer Evan Tindell, who has taken a short position on Apple's stock. Tindell believes that risks ranging from fluctuating demand in China to potential antitrust concerns ""are reflected in that premium valuation"" for Apple. As the company explores integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its smartphones, he notes, ""It will be interesting to see"" if this endeavor can truly materialize into a substantial earnings driver or upstart a replacement cycle for their devices. Despite the company's announcement of a $110 billion share buyback program, Tindell remains skeptical, asserting that this move does not accurately reflect the company's valuation multiples. ""I think if you hold Apple long-term, you're likely to make a positive return,"" Tindell tells Yahoo Finance. ""I just think the risks are to the downside in the next year or two.""

Recently, reports have shown that iPhone sales have slumped in China. Is Apple up for the challenge to reinvigorate its position in international markets and how will all this manifest in its May 2 earnings release? TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Apple's largest problems in the domestic US market and abroad, and how the iPhone maker might go about solving them. ""Between the iPhone sales, between the geopolitical issues in China, which is still a very big market for them, and now they're having to do a little bit more of what the Chinese government is requesting, Huawei is getting stronger in China. There's nationalistic movements there to try and pull some of the US companies out. The car project was canceled, which I think, in the long run, was the right thing to do, but it could have been interesting earlier if they kind of figured out a different path,"" O'Donnell lists off.

Higgins names Apple shares as his good buy, stating that the tech leader may be on the up-and-up after the stock slid in 2024's first quarter. Higgins points to Apple's quick adoption and integration of AI into its devices as a major catalyst. ""They have been gobbling up AI companies below the radar — I think they've bought 32 of them,"" Higgins says. ""Clearly they're working on it because If they don't they're facing an existential threat to their very survival. I think Apple has been keeping its head down while its stock has faltered."" Arm is the stock Higgins would wish to say good buy to, calling the semiconductor designer overvalued as early investors were ""looking for different ways to chase Nvidia (NVDA)"" in the broad chip landscape.

According to a new report from Charles Schwab, these tech leaders continue to remain popular among retail investors going forward. Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education Joe Mazzola joins The Morning Brief to discuss why these companies remain popular amongst retail investors and takes a look at potential trends for the upcoming earnings season that may impact these stocks.

In 2023, the tech juggernaut generated over $575 billion in revenue, boasting more than 200 million Amazon Prime members worldwide. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into some of the company's biggest moments. 1994 Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington. It was originally an online bookstore designed to compete with Barnes & Noble (BNED). 1997 On May 15, 1997, Amazon went public via IPO at $18 per share, giving it a valuation of $300 million. 1998 Amazon began selling CDs, marking the start of its effort to become a shopping Goliath. 2005 The company launched Amazon Prime, a $79 per year membership with free two-day shipping on eligible orders. 2006 Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform would go on to become the top cloud computing platform, ahead of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and one of Amazon’s most successful businesses. 2011 The company rebranded its video service as Amazon Instant Video with access to 5,000 movies and TV shows for Prime members. 2014 Amazon acquired the video game streaming website Twitch for $970 million. 2017 Amazon acquired high-end supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. It has since integrated the two companies, offering discounts to Prime members. 2018 On September 4, 2018, Amazon became just the second US company ever to reach a $1 trillion market cap, after Apple (AAPL) reached it earlier in the year. 2020 Amazon's sales and profits surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, as consumers turned to online shopping. Its total sales increased 38% year-over-year to $386.1 billion, and net income increased 83% to $21.3 billion. 2021 Founder Jeff Bezos announced that he would step down from his role as CEO and be succeeded by AWS CEO Andy Jassy. 2024 Amazon was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing drugstore giant Walgreens (WBA). The company continues to evolve, investing billions in AI startup Anthropic, developing more smart home products, and launching an AI shopping assistant named Rufus. It’s safe to say Amazon is a staple of the digital age. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Many of the big names in tech — Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — have been grouped together and referred to as The Magnificent Seven, but some, like Apple and Tesla, have fallen off from great heights.

TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to break down the recent movements in the tech sector and how its major players can operate moving forward. O'Donnell talks about potential leaders in tech for the long-term: ""The one thing is, Nvidia's got 90% share. Anybody who's got 90% share is going to lose a little share. But, that doesn't mean they still can't grow organically from where they are. You're just going to see a lot more competitors. If we look at it collectively, I still think there is several years of growth in the collective semiconductor market for AI-powered stuff.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is closing the quarter at a new record high, marking the best first quarter since 2019.

Following its market debut, Reddit (RDDT) outperformed expectations after positioning itself as an AI play. Bedrock Founder & Managing Partner Geoff Lewis joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into how AI is disrupting various sectors in the market. Lewis focuses particularly on OpenAI and its possible future maneuvers. He compares the company's current legal situation to the ""early days of Facebook"" (META): ""Facebook had a lot of lawsuits as well. I say bring on the lawsuits with respect to OpenAI. I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year, predominantly with consumers. They've only recently launched offerings to enterprises. It's been publicly reported they're north of a $2 billion revenue run rate. I don't think we've ever seen either in the private markets a revenue ramp that's been this rapid.""

Constellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R ""Ray"" Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what investors are expected to hear from the tech giant at its annual event. Wang notes that with Apple's extensive involvement in artificial intelligence, investors are eager to see how the company plans to incorporate AI into iPhones, stating, ""it hasn't always been explicit."" He mentions that with upcoming iOS upgrades across Apple's product lines, investors will be looking to understand how AI will ""bring Apple devices to life."" Wang emphasizes the importance of collaborations, suggesting that a potential partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) could be in the works. He believes it's crucial for Apple to demonstrate that ""they are part of that ecosystem."" Wang views this potential deal as ""one step towards the integration"" of AI more prominently at Apple. However, he believes that as time goes on, investors will see ""more partnerships emerge"" as AI integration develops further.

Sixteen US attorneys general are joining the DOJ suit alleging Apple's practice of creating a monopoly in the smartphone and digital app store markets. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin — who is among the state attorneys general pushing for this case — breaks down the consumer harm Apple's anticompetitive methods have done: ""What we lay out is a pattern that Apple has engaged in of using its market share to restrict and exclude business practices in a way that stifles innovation and makes it harder for consumers to leave the iPhone platform. And as a result of that, it has driven up significantly its own profits and the cost of the products to consumers, so that now in 2024, people are paying over $1,500 for an iPhone, that if you adjust the 2007 price of an iPhone for inflation, it would only be $450.""

Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani — who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share — joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of. Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses ""more headline risk than fundamental risk,"" stating that he doesn't believe it has ""a material impact"" on Apple. However, he suggests that how ""elements in the US play out"" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as ""an AI story."" He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good ""value [proposition]"" for the company's stock.

NetChoice Vice President and General Counsel Carl Szabo joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he believes the Department of Justice faces an ""uphill climb"" in this legal battle.

He points out that when Americans buy a smartphone, they have ""two clear choices"": Apple and Android devices, disbarring any assumptions of a monopoly. He notes as this legal battle continues, Apple's innovation efforts may be impacted ""out of fear"" of being accused of monopolistic practices. Szabo notes that as long as Apple can provide evidence that supports ""business purposes for what they are doing,"" the courts will most likely rule in their favor. He suggests that many of the concerns raised by the DOJ can be ""easily dismissed"" due to the legitimate purposes they serve in relation to Apple products like security prevention and payment processing.

Udland points to the continued tech rally and market capital gains as sources of optimism. As heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) experience significant declines, lagging behind other ""Magnificent Seven"" names, Udland identifies Eli Lilly (LLY) and Costco (COST) as potential contenders to replace these stocks. Costco, he highlights, continues to benefit from the premiumization of consumer habits. Udland also stresses the significance of next Wednesday's dot plot release from the Federal Reserve, dubbing it ""the most important dot plot ever."" He explains that current market reactions are based on the expectation of three rate cuts by the Fed.

The company has seen four quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, weakness in Chinese markets, a hefty EU fine, and a major patent dispute.

Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Apple's performance and her optimism about a turnaround. Martin points to Apple's installed base of two billion devices: ""What they have is sort of consumer lock-in for that group of devices...Maybe demand is slower in China, but they have these really wonderfully wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem. So they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth, its a $600 billion a year business and they do $2 billion a year in it. They need to add advertising to get growth back and also advertising has 80% profit margins.

Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term. With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility."" However, he suggests that investors should view this volatility as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and strategically position themselves for evolving market conditions.

Are these companies doomed to fall from the pack or does the dip represent an opportunity to buy? Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors. Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up. Third is continuation in growth. Really good growth in their energy storage business.""
